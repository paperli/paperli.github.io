<!--summary-->

Gallery AR turns the wall, the room, the house or even the city to the gallery with a bunch of famous masterpieces. The app integrates the open art databases from the Chicago Art Institute and places the art masterpieces on your space walls. As easy as holding the phone against the wall and start the art tour right away. Try walking as close as you can and don't worry about being kicked out by the security guard. Just be careful with the walls ;)

As easy as holding the phone against the wall and start the art tour right away. It doesn't limit to a single wall. You can scan as many walls as you like and open the scaled gallery as your wish. Try walking as close as you can and don't worry about being kicked out by the security guard. Just be careful with the walls ;)
