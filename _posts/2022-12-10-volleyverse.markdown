Step into the world of Volleyverse, where voice commands shape reality! Within a mere 24-hour hackathon, we manifested an enchanting "Making-A-Wish" experience exclusively for the Quest headsets. By seamlessly integrating the Wit.ai voice AI engine, users express their desires vocally, unveiling delightful gifts seamlessly integrated into their surroundings via the headset's passthrough feature. We presend our creation during the holiday season, serving as a conduit for spreading merriment and extending heartfelt Christmas wishes to all volley employees.

The mixed reality universe is going to shape the computing future, and we wonder how the voice interaction can become an impact on such a platform. I led the 3-people hackathon team to invest ina Wit.ai voice AI engine and integrate

The prototype implements 2 input modes, controller and hand tracking. The hand tracking mode provides the instinct interaction experience yet controllers serve precise scale and pan movement.

### Metropolis Model

Blender offers the convenient workflow to create metropolis with real world terrain by using the OSM plug-in. I choose Tokyo as the map basis to copy the high-rise and techno vibe of the city.

### Shader and Unity Universal RP

To represent the techno vibe of the map, the building landscape applies the custom shader to fade the bottom of the building and glow at the high elevation. With Unity Universal Render Pipeline, the shader can be made easily in Shader Graph. It improves the workflow for artists to create desired visual effects to a project.

The prototype shows the funny nature of the VR. The miniature city model inspires the joy and the instinct interaction can be very useful to the VR RPG and open-world games. It also makes me understand better to the story in Ready Player Two and reminds me of the VR's nature strength in representing the real-world scale replica.
