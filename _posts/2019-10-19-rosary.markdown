eRosary is the companion app for the smart Christian rosary beads. The app records and displays the collected activity data and provides several Vatican-certified prays and contents for Christian prayers.

Christians can follow the step-by-step guide to pray Rosaries and other prayers. The smart beads detect the turning activity and help to count the praying progress automatically.

The smart beads record the daily activity, and the app displays real-time data and saves it in statistics. It also records the praying history and daily progress to encourage Vatican-proposed praying behavior.

The app lists the articles from the Pope and helps to engage the users to Holy See. ClickToPray updates the content from time to time, and the app also includes the feature to allow users to browse the archive.

### Design

I conducted the persona and use cases in the study phase and made the flow document as clear as possible to drive the fluent communication among the team, Acer and Vatican authority. The multi-layer stockholders relationship was sometimes intense, and the document usually helped eliminate the gap between groups.
