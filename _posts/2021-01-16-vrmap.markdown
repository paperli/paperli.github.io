The map interaction experience reminds the VR's strength in representing real-world scale replica. The instinct interaction with simple hands gestures with miniature metropolis inspires the joy in the RPG and open-world games in VR.

Inspired by Ready Player Two and Cyberpunk 2077, the map prototype features in red-purple theme and allow users to zoom and pan by both hands pinching and pan gestures.

The prototype implements 2 input modes, controller and hand tracking. The hand tracking mode provides the instinct interaction experience yet controllers serve precise scale and pan movement.

### Metropolis Model

Blender offers the convenient workflow to create metropolis with real world terrain by using the OSM plug-in. I choose Tokyo as the map basis to copy the high-rise and techno vibe of the city.

### Shader and Unity Universal RP

To represent the techno vibe of the map, the building landscape applies the custom shader to fade the bottom of the building and glow at the high elevation. With Unity Universal Render Pipeline, the shader can be made easily in Shader Graph. It improves the workflow for artists to create desired visual effects to a project.

The prototype shows the funny nature of the VR. The miniature city model inspires the joy and the instinct interaction can be very useful to the VR RPG and open-world games. It also makes me understand better to the story in Ready Player Two and reminds me of the VR's nature strength in representing the real-world scale replica.
