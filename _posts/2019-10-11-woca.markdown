### Design

There is always a good plan for a great product. The development of Woca replied on the well-organized user needs and design document. I summarized the expects from different angles of stockholders and target audiences and organized the feature sheet to be the app's basis. When the task dropped even further, I used several prototypes and mockups to figure out useful yet exciting interactions. I put them into the flow document to serve as the communication basis to developers and stockholders.
