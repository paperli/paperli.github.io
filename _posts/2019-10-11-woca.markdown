### AI/AR Camera

The AI-empowered AR camera in Woca extends the learning experience into the real world. It also serves as the pioneer media for Diing to explore cutting-edge vision technologies.

### Pronunciation

Woca pronounces the word when the user taps the card title. The separating animation during the pronunciation teaches learners about how the syllable works and acts as the fun factor to the app.

### Collection

We learned from the games and sports activities and knew that people love collecting beautiful cards as the fan culture thing. In Woca, you can collect stunning word card into your collection by simple interactions.

### Design

There is always a good plan for a great product. The development of Woca replied on the well-organized user needs and design document. I summarized the expectations from different stockholders' prospectives and target audiences and organized the feature sheet to be the app's basis. When the task dropped even further, I used several prototypes and mockups to figure out useful yet exciting interactions. I put them into the flow document to serve as the communication basis to developers and stockholders.

### Framer Prototypes

Woca integrates a variety of transitions and animations to make interactions more fun and responsive. I made prototypes in Framer for each effect to prove the design and propose to the R&D team. Framer is the codable design tool for interaction designers to create rich interactive prototypes with Javascript. It played a vital role during the development of Woca.
