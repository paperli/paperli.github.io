Among immersive app users, there’s a common desire to walk around freely in open virtual worlds with “sliding” movement. When hands become a more dominant interaction media in spatial computing, inheriting users’ intention to explore worlds is an unsolved challenge. The prototype in this study examinates the hand local motion by letting users use the pinch gesture to replicate the thumbstick moving behavior. The user testing result shows that users can easily move around with such a gesture without significant motion sickness. However, mapping local-rotating, jumping, and even flying is still a challenge and it feeds the future exploration.

## People Problem

> I want to move around in the immersive virtual world.

When we explore a new immersive experience, I frequently heard friends asking about “how to move?” “how do I turn on sliding mode?”. And oftently, I see that they are already moving before they accomplish the question. People see a new world and they want to explore. It's a built DNA which remains true in virtual environment. 

## Challenge

> How do I move around with my bare hands?

Using hands is natural in many interface media. The emerging spatial computing platforms push hand tracking into the main stage of user interaction in virtual worlds. For example, Apple’s upcoming Vision Pro product doesn't ship with dedicated controllers. Meta also keeps investigating and improving their hand-tracking accountability. Common and reliable gestures have been well-defined by those big players, however, how to move around in spatial experiences remains unsettled.

I see that experienced VR players tend to “slide” around the open virtual worlds by turning the thumbstick in games like VRChat, Sprial, AltspaceVR, etc. When those games are migrated into the hand-tracking-dominated spatial computing experience, making users move around with their inherent habits becomes a challenge and yet the opportunity to build players’ confidence to adopt the interaction.

## User Insights

* Experienced VR players tend to “slide” around in open virtual worlds by turning the thumbstick on their controller.￼
* The continuous movement makes them move freely and it matches how they move in real life more closely than teleporting.
￼Continuous movement can also cause motion sickness with the fact that you see the world is moving but you sense no movement in your physical body.
   * However, we have seen that some people are easier to get motion sickness than others in the same program. 
   * We also see people may feel sick in one app but not in another one by using the same sliding movement. The visual effect and acceleration settings can contribute to motion sickness to users, while the level can also be differed by individuals. 
* Users who have used hand tracking on VR headsets before are already familiar with the pinch gesture, which has been defined as the main interactor in the major spatial computing devices.

## Resolution
In this experiment, users touch their thumb and index fingertips together and traverse across the directional pad to move themselves in the virtual world.

## User Testing And Take-aways

Our collaborative synergy thrived throughout the intense 24-hour sprint, culminating in a compelling live demo presented before the entire Volley team.
