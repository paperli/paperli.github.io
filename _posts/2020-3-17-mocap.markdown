MoCáp saves the motion data into the flexible bvh file. You can then use it in your favorite 3D character creation tool, like Cinema 4D, Maya/MotionBuilder, Blender, Poser, to name but a few. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="video-embed"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/452005738?color=ff0179&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

MoCáp uses the AR camera to detect a human body and record the movements in more than 20 joints in the skeleton. The conversion then takes part and translates the raw motion data into a single bvh file. The bvh file is an industry-standard motion capture file format and widely imposed in the most main-stream 3D creation tools.

MoCáp also integrates multiple functionalities to improve the accessibility to single usage, which is the most common use case for indie artists. The countdown timer gives the user the time to set-up himself/herself in front of the camera before the recording starts. The sound effects for recorder status let the user know when a recording is going to start. MoCáp also delays the recording until the AR camera detects a human body. The Apple Watch version of the remoter is also under development.

MoCáp is free to download and has a single tier of Grande membership for professional function sets, such as framerate settings, motion file format options, full-access of whole recording history, etc. The users can try the app without pressure, and it's their choice to pay for the full functionality of the app.

Since launching, MoCáp has constantly hit the 100+ top chart in the Graphics & Design category in the App Store.
