In end of 2012, I joined the joyful team MobiApps to lead the UX and UI design. We server the mobile app for retail sale and small business. With rapid design pattern, the mobile app can be prompt built and delivered. The flexibility of the team allowed me to break out serveral concepts including smart no-content mode, social biz UI, etc.. Still, I used variable tools like Dropbox or TAP to rapidly test new concept.
