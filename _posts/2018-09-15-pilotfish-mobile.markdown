Pilotfish goes to mobile!

Pilotfish was reforming official website to meet fashion web spec, aka. no flash, go mobile. I was in the team to redesign the flow/wireframe of new offical website (include desktop and mobile version). I made bunch of demo units in HTML to present flow, transition and movement to developer outsourcing.

The website was announced in end 2012.
