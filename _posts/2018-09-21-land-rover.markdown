The pair of apps build a direct communication channel between Land Rover car owners and dealers. The chat-based apps provide the bi-directional interaction model between both sides and cease the long-time communication problem. The system also provides a convenient way to broadcast the brand's message and efficiently manage the booking of services.

Land Rover China was building its manufacturing chain in China. In MobiApps, we cooperated with the Shanghai team and developed the communication channel between car owners and dealers. The chat-based apps provide the bi-directional interaction model between both sides and cease the long-time communication problem.

The system also provides a convenient way to broadcast the brand's message and efficiently manage the booking of services. The car owners can contact dealers directly, and it also means that the dealer can get first-hand feedback or complain from customers and respond without barrier.

### Prototype

A prototype is the most efficient way to validate the design idea. I made different levels of prototypes for each design phase to ensure the design aligns with user needs and stakeholders' expectations. I usually start with hand sketching at the beginning and go deeper to wireframes at later stages. I choose different tools to accomplish the prototype based on the purpose. As an example below, I used Marvel to create the navigation prototype to validate the interaction flow.

### CARS - Stop Motion Movie

In the early days of the development, I led colleagues to complete the stop motion video to give us an insight into the usage cases. The production also grouped the team from different disciplines to form a union for the final product.
