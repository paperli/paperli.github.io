    "title" : "Just Dessert",
    "origin" : "United States",
    "tale" : "One of only three works William Michael Harnett painted in the year before his death, Just Dessert offers the viewer a display of foodstuffs sumptuously arranged on a marble surface. The traditional tabletop composition is one that Harnett often employed in his still lifes. In Just Dessert, the exotic clashes with the quotidian—Maraschino liqueur, half a coconut, and Smyrna figs rest alongside a copperpitcher, pewter tankard, and ginger jar. Small crumbs of cork are visible on the grapes and fig seeds are smashed on the side of the wooden box, indicating that the dessert has been eaten, as well as highlighting Harnett’s skillful renderings in trompe l’oeil (fool-the-eye) painting.",

    "tale" : "Since the late 1960s, the pioneering Realist artist Chuck Close has used the human face, tightly framed, as the basis for his art. In 1987 the artist made 24-x-20-inch Polaroid portraits of several fellow artists, which he then turned into studies for oil paintings. Two years later, he suffered a collapsed spinal artery, which severely limited his mobility and confined him to a wheelchair. With great determination, Close regained his former control of his medium, as this monumental portrait of the artist Alex Katz demonstrates. Like much of his recent work, it is less an exact likeness than an exploration of process. Incremental blips of paint—circles, dots, and dashes—are laid into a grid corresponding to the original photographic study.",

    "tale" : "Sandro Botticelli’s works mark the culmination of a mystical religious tradition in the art of early Renaissance Florence, from the paintings of Lorenzo Monaco and Fra Angelico through those of Fra Filippo Lippi, Botticelli’s teacher. In this lyrical late work by Botticelli, two angels draw back curtains to reveal the Virgin and Child, who are framed by slender trees in a setting suggesting a throne. The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ’s gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function. This supposition is supported by the choice of format, since a Florentine patron would have typically commissioned a circular painting, or tondo, for use in a bedchamber.",

    "tale" : "Athenian cemeteries housed a variety of monuments and offerings to the dead. This terracotta vessel, called a lekythos, is one example that held oil. From the middle until the end of the fifth century B.C., they were usually decorated in a distinctive technique known as white ground, so called after the light slip coating on the body and shoulder of the vase. Atop this, figures were usually drawn in outline and then painted in rich colors, many of which have since faded. Since most of these bottles were made for burial with the dead or to be left at their graves, the scenes on their surfaces typically represent tombs, visitors to tombs, and farewell scenes. \nHere two men, perhaps father and son, bid one another farewell. On the left, the young man departs, spear in hand, but he looks back toward an older man with a walking stick, who watches him go. The latter man’s hair and beard are white. He wears a russet-colored mantle that appears sheer, clearly revealing the contours of his body underneath."

His early work in the 1960s took the form of brightly painted plaster reliefs and sculptures of foodstuffs and other commercial products. Later the canvas props that Oldenburg had sewn for earlier performancebased events led to large-scale soft sculptures. By the mid-1960s, the artist turned his attention to drawings and proposals for outdoor monuments—some imaginary, some real. A 45-foot-tall version of Clothespin is installed near City Hall in Philadelphia.",

    "tale" : "Homer created sparkling watercolor sketches of sailboats in Bahamian waters during his 1898-99 Bahamas trip. When he visited Key West, Florida, in the winter of 1903-04, he further indulged his interest in the details of local boating. There, Homer painted Stowing Sail on December 22, 1903. Everything about this watercolor points toward rapid, plein-air execution.The artist’s graphite underdrawing is a quick and sketchy series of lines that establish the major contours on the sheet. Pentiments, or shifts, in the underdrawing show that when he began the sketch, the figure was leaning further forward, gathering the sail over the back of the boat. This adjustment suggests that Homer was working quickly to keep up with the man’s progress.Homer applied all of his washes directly within the forms marked in the underdrawing, working wet-on-wet, as if there were not enough time to wait for one to dry before adding the next. When he brushed the heavy, red stroke at the front of the boat, it bled upward into the still-wet blue shadow on the side."

This tour-de-force series established the popularity of landscape prints, which continues to this day. Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions. \nThe most famous image from the set is the \"Great Wave\" (Kanagawa oki nami ura), in which a diminutive Mount Fuji can be seen in the distance under the crest of a giant wave. The three impressions of Hokusai’s Great Wave in the Art Institute are all later impressions than the first state of the design.",

He probably painted this head, as well as the one executed with equally loose brushwork on the reverse of the canvas, as a study for his own use. Both images were also engraved as illustrations for Johann Caspar Lavater’s influential book on physiognomy (the science of facial structure). According to the text, the heads were inspired by damned souls in Dante Alighieri’s epic poem Inferno. Throughout his career, Fuseli favored heroic subjects taken from the work of Dante, John Milton, and William Shakespeare, and he drew formal inspiration from Michelangelo, whom he equated with his literary heroes.",

About forty Roman sculptural representations of Meleager survive, leading scholars to conclude that there was likely an earlier Greek statue on which they are based, presumably by the architect and sculptor Skopas of Paros, who incorporated a marble relief depicting the Calydonian boar hunt on one of his buildings. However, none of the ancient authors who wrote about Greek sculpture mention that Skopas created a large-scale, three-dimensional statue of Meleager, so the attribution to him is uncertain.",

In the passage, Kukai describes a dream he had as a child in which he was carried aloft on an eight-petaled lotus flower to a heavenly realm where he conversed with various Buddhas. The practice of depicting religious leaders as children during miraculous moments in their lives would have been keenly reassuring to Buddhist devotees.",

Whereas images of the Buddha appear sternly formal, bodhisattvas, the merciful deities that guide men toward salvation, often display more humanistic features. This bodhisattva’s graceful proportions, upswept hair, sinuous drapery, and delicate jewelry convey an appealing physical elegance. Seated informally, the deity is poised to step down from its pedestal. \nTogether with a large seated Buddha and another attendant bodhisattva in the Art Institute collection (1930.83, 1930.84), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site. The scale and stone medium of these figures suggest that they were commissioned for a cave temple or shrine a chamber carved into the face of a mountain or cliff.",

He taught at the Bauhaus for most of the famed school’s existence; initially head of the bookbinding department, he also supervised the glass-painting workshop. His greatest influence, however, was as a lecturer for the basic design course on the theory of form in art. In lectures, Klee developed his ideas about the \"polyphony\" of painting, which was based on his interest in simultaneous sensational effects that could be created by various layered formal elements. He believed that this type of creative experimentation could \"issue forth a transformed beholder of art\" and thus pave the way for total abstraction.",

    "tale" : "James McNeill Whistler painted marine subjects throughout his career. For several years beginning in 1855, the expatriate American artist divided his time between London and Paris; in the latter, he was exposed to the bold realism and thickly impastoed surfaces of the paintings of Gustave Courbet. The older artist’s influence shaped Whistler’s depiction of the Thames River, a subject that frequently appeared in his work after he moved to London in 1863. In this painting, he focused on the river’s industrial nature—boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys—which featured so largely in urban life. Yet despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.",

    "tale" : "Degas is best known for his images of the ballet and other scenes from modem urban life. However, periodically he explored the landscape genre, with a trip in 1869 to the Normandy Coast, for example, that resulted in a number of pastel landscapes. During the peak years of Impressionism-the 1870s and 1880s, when landscape reigned supreme among France’s avant-garde-Degas was notoriously averse to the practice of open-air landscape painting. Yet in the 1890s, he produced several groups of landscapes, combining observation and invention in various ways. The artist’s renewed interest was prompted by a trip he took he took through Burgundy in 1890 that inspired him to treat its landscape using the technique of monotype. A monotype is made by painting or drawing an image in greasy printer ‘s ink on a metal plate and then printing the plate onto a sheet of paper. Only one strong impression can usually be pulled from the plate; on occasion, a second, paler impression known as a monotype cognate can be pulled as well. Degas sometimes completed pastels over monotypes or monotype, cognates, as in Landscape with Smokestacks. He pioneered this technique in the 1870s. He began some of his monotypes on the spot, while others-possibly Landscape with Smokestacks-were recollections. Certainly, Degas’s aim in such compositions was quite different from his colleague Claude Monet’s preoccupation with changing atmospheric effects. While rooted in experience, Degas’s landscapes of memory are brooding and mysterious.",

    "tale" : "Jean Dubuffet had a vast knowledge of classical art and culture, but he sought a new path for his art based outside Western artistic conventions. He became a proponent of art brut (raw art), an anti-aesthetic inspired by the art of children, the mentally ill, prisoners, and those “unscathed by artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part.” In his quest for a dynamic, expressive, and authentic style, Dubuffet developed a technique of scratching into thickly impastoed paint surfaces, often mixed with materials from the earth, to produce raw, graffiti-like images. This painting of the poet Jules Supervielle comes from a series of crude portraits of Parisian writers and intellectuals that the artist made from his imagination, depersonalizing and transforming his subjects into caricatures of human types.",

    "title" : "Portrait of Joaneta Obrador",
    "tale" : "This painting belongs to a group of fascinating and highly individual works by Joan Miró that document his early efforts to grapple with revolutionary developments in modern art (such as Fauvism and Cubism) and to forge his own direction. These efforts culminated in the early 1920s in the artist’s breakthrough to a style of fantastic, simplified forms, freely and loosely scattered across the surface of his pictures with an exuberant abandon that is hard to imagine based on this tightly constructed portrait. And yet, something of this exuberance—of the vitality and poetic intensity of Miró‘s later works—seems indeed to underly this strangely powerful portrait, manifesting itself, for example, in the unrestrained rhythms of the dress, barely held in check by the diamond grid in the background, or in the lyrical note introduced by the small flower on the front of the dress.Different and often contrasting impulses are brought here into uneasy balance through the sheer force of Miró’s talent for creating compelling simplifications of the forms before him. The strong rhythms established by the dress, wallpaper, and face all vie for attention, as do the artist’s various sources of inspiration: the influence of the Fauves and especially of  Henri Matisse in the bold use of color, dense application of paint, and flat patterning of the dress and background; the effect of Cubism in the far more sculptural, angular treatment of the face; and the impact of the Romanesque frescoes of Miró’s native Catalonia (which the artist himself acknowledged as a major inspiration) in the linear rhythms of the dress, hair, and background, in the frontal pose, and in the large, staring eyes. This is a painting of dramatic contrasts, between the insistent flatness of the dress and back-ground and the Cubist modeling of the face, between the startling pink of the wallpaper and the restrained black-and-white color scheme of the dress, between the human presence of the sitter and the strong linear patterns that threaten to engulf it. It does not seem surprising, given the impact this portrait still has today, that the young woman who initially agreed to sit for it became frightened both by Miró’s intensity and his strange style of painting, forcing him to finish the portrait from memory. \n—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 152-153.",

The yellow half-circle at the top could represent the sun, one of Dove’s favorite subjects, and the areas of green and brown may be the earth below. When he exhibited this work in 1942 at An American Place, Dove published a poem in the catalogue, which includes the lines “There is much to be done— \/ Works of nature are abstract. \/ They do not lean on other things for meanings.” The title of this painting sums up Dove’s artistic project over the four decades of his career: to capture the abstraction of nature by creating “a reasonable facsimile” of its appearance.",

Here the figure’s head and arms, now missing, were made separately and attached by means of dowels, the holes for which are visible.",

    "tale" : "X-radiographs have revealed that this painting is a fragment of Les Gitanes, a large portrait of a gypsy family exhibited by Édouard Manet in 1863 and 1867. Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. The artist painted out part of the head of a female gypsy, replaced blue sky with a dark brown ground, and extensively reworked the figure of the boy. He then renamed the painting La Régalade, which means to pour liquid from a bottle down the throat without touching the lips.",

Although he had previously experimented with found objects and sculpture, Magritte did not conceive of painting “in the round” until the war years, when discarded bottles—many of his favored Bordeaux, but also port and sherry—proved useful for his playful experiments at the intersection of painting and sculpture. Over his lifetime, Magritte created more than 25 works in this format, many of which he presented to his friends as gifts.",

    "tale" : "Mike Kelley’s work takes pleasure in perversion and embraces bad taste. Many of his early sculptures employ secondhand dolls and stuffed animals. Used, soiled, and discarded, Kelley’s toys violate the sentimental association of youth with innocence. Eviscerated Corpse, from his series Half a Man, is one of the artist’s bestknown objects. Its cartoonish horror presents childhood as pathology: dolls and stuffed animals lack sexual specificity, which perhaps reflects the desire of adults to maintain the chastity of children. Kelley said that “the stuffed animal is a pseudo-child, a cutified sexless being which represents the adult’s perfect model of a child—a neutered pet.” His icon of childhood is a hypersexualized monster, with the tiny doll either spilling its intestines, giving birth, or both.",

Here the Virgin supports the Child on a cushion that appears to rest on the edge of the picture’s frame, as though revealing the infant to the viewer through a window opening. Van der Weyden used elements such as the gems decorating the Virgin’s dress, her pearl-studded circlet, and the thronelike associations of the rich red velvet hanging behind her to characterize her as the queen of heaven. At the same time, by depicting her nurturing her infant, the artist emphasized Christ’s human nature and the Virgin’s role as an intercessor for mankind.",

He is equipped to guide the spiritual traveler past temptation on the path to enlightenment. Fudo’s bulging eyes, piercing stare, and protruding fangs express the intensity of his wrath against evil. Seated on a stylized rock formation that symbolizes his steadfastness, he once held his attributes, a rope and sword (these have been removed for conservation), which were used to subdue evil forces and to cut through the ignorance that is the source of suffering. This finely modeled figure reflects the highly detailed, realistic direction taken by Japanese sculptors in the Kamakura period (1185–1333).",

Whistler dedicated much of his artistic practice to capturing the mood and color harmonies of marine scenes.

    "tale" : "In January 1904, Homer traveled to Homosassa, Florida, to fish. The Homosassa River, on the gulf side of the state, was home to many fish species and supported a lush wildlife habitat. It was in Homosassa that Homer painted his final tropical watercolors, including Life-Size Black Bass. In this work, the artist placed the underside of the huge, brightly colored fish at center and close to the viewer, bringing alive the drama, immediacy, and excitement of the fisherman’s experience as his fly, a “scarlet ibis,” hangs in the air. With trademark ambiguity, Homer presented the bass suspended between life and death. Will it succeed in grabbing its bright target only to seal its fate? The fish’s sudden jump slices through the dark, quiet jungle with a momentary flash of life and color.In order to force the viewer into the path of the leaping fish, Homer cropped three centimeters off the lower edge of Life-Size Black Bass. He then centered and framed the fish for maximum effect by trimming a total of 2 centimeters from the right and left edges. The sheet dimensions are 350 x 526 millimeters; the original sheet dimensions were 380 x 545 millimeters as compared with uncut sheets of the same paper type. The trimmed edges appear slightly uneven and lack any adhesive residue from the watercolor paper block. As in a photograph with a short focal length, Homer presented the fish in tight focus against a vague and fluid background. With these compositional choices Homers heightened the tension of the strong, vital bass, frozen in motion, before capture and death. Such dramatic psychological impact results from Homer’s three decades of persistent observation using watercolor to transcribe nature on paper.",

Impeccably composed, with rich and varied textures and forms, his images range from unpeopled streets, parks, and monuments to cafes, street vendors, and shop windows. In Boulevard de Strasbourg (Corsets), rows of hourglass-shaped busts emerge out of darkness, while a dangling corset swings in the cracked doorway, animating the entire scene (Atget’s old-fashioned camera often recorded moving objects as blurred). Atget sold these cultural documents for modest sums to artists, craftspeople, and institutions interested in preserving the past. It was not until after 1925, when his work was publicized by the expatriate American artists Man Ray and Berenice Abbott, that his photographs began to be recognized by a wider art world.",

    "tale" : "Seeking an expressive and modern manner of painting, Rufino Tamayo fused Mexican traditions with avant-garde artistic innovations. In Woman with a Bird Cage, the influence of Cubism is apparent in Tamayo’s depiction of the woman’s body, which has been fractured into planes of color. Yet her distinctive elongated ear, large nose, open mouth, and the other aspects of her physiognomy reflect the artist’s study of Pre-Columbian art. Although Tamayo, unlike his countrymen Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, did not address overtly social themes in his paintings, his references to the ancient and indigenous art forms of his country suggest that his art was no less concerned with aspects of Mexican identity."

An armor garniture consisted of many matching, interchangeable pieces that could be added or removed from basic field armor to make it suitable for different occasions. Like jousting armor, this armor for foot tourneys at the barriers—a sporting event in which knights on foot approached each other on opposite sides of a barrier—is quite specialized. It includes a close helmet that locked onto and rotated on the gorget (collar) and asymmetrical pauldrons (shoulder defenses) that provided maneuverability and protection from thrusting across the barrier. The blemish on the helmet of this armor, just above the eye slit, is the result of a glancing blow. This armor, embellished with gilded radiating bands contrasted with steel bands, as well as the Three-Quarter Armor, belonged to the Spanish Marquesses de Dos Aguas.",

The Mexican Major is an elaborate, multifigural composition, designed to convey the professionalism, discipline, and “immensely picturesque” appearance of the officer and his regiment. Remington enjoyed the soldiers’ ornate costumes, and he emphasized these through the use of rhythmic, flashing colors and the depiction of brilliant light. The line of horsemen stretches off into the far distance—a sign of honor, strength, and dignity."

No doubt originally set amid a profusion of other wild and exotic animals, giraffes such as this one captivated the imagination of those who saw them in parades and public games. Writing around the turn of the third century, the historian Cassius Dio (about A.D. 150–235), among others, called this marvelous creature a Camelopardus because, in his opinion, the giraffe combined the physical traits of both the camel and the leopard.",

    "tale" : "Cy Twombly often titled his early 1960s works with florid evocations of art, myth, and allegory. These paintings, for example, refer to Mount Parnassus, the fabled home of Apollo and the Muses, which became known as the center of poetry, music, and learning in ancient Greece. These early paintings mix regular, system-based forms, numbers, and grids together with irregular, nature-based pictograms and suggestive or intuitive references to corporeal processes—sexual and otherwise. These are aspects of a general practice in which Twombly juxtaposes such marks to connote the dualities of mind and body. In their exuberant scale and color, the artist’s works of 1961 also reflect his response to the great architectural spaces of Rome, embracing the city’s grandeur and decadence in its ancient, Baroque, and modern incarnations.",

Singled out on the left wing is Saint Ursula, thought to have been a British princess who set out on a pilgrimage to Rome, only to be martyred along with a throng of her virgin companions. Saint Agnes, another martyr of the early Christian era, is on the right wing. The triptych’s focus on youthful, female saints and its lyrical, slightly naive painting style suggest that it was made for a community of nuns. The gold framing arches refer to the combination of gilded sculpture and painting that was a common feature of German altarpieces in this period.",

    "tale" : "Cleopatra (69–30 BCE) was queen of Egypt when the Roman Empire was gradually expanding into the wealthy eastern Mediterranean. By allying herself first with the powerful Roman generals Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) and then Mark Antony (83–30 BCE), she hoped to maintain her country’s independence and her own authority. The political alliance between Antony and Cleopatra worried Caesar’s heir, Octavian, who, in 31 BCE, defeated the couple in a sea battle. Rather than suffer the humiliation of surrender, Cleopatra and Antony killed themselves. \nThis coin was minted during Antony and Cleopatra’s alliance. By pairing their faces on coinage, the rulers advertised their powerful partnership, which was so strong that Cleopatra’s profile is an exact copy of Antony’s portrait. Cleopatra’s image appears on the front of the coin, which identifies her as the more important of the two rulers. A crown circling her carefully braided hair symbolizes her status as a queen."

His atelier became the site of groundbreaking experimentation, as he regularly combined and recombined the component parts of individual works and rearranged their placement within groups. The complete ensemble of Brancusi’s White Negress II unites the natural elements of stone and wood into an exploration of modern, abstract form, weight, and mass balanced with great lightness and delicacy. The artist avoided having a dealer and instead preferred to show his work to clients and friends in his studio. By the 1950s, his groupings were so critical to his aesthetic goals that he began to refuse to sell his works so that they could remain in their carefully orchestrated installations.",

Their art added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic. Mid American, an early painting that Paschke reworked several times, exemplifies the artist’s characteristic style, which utilized luminous, electric colors and fantastic imagery, yet remained rooted in a gritty realism. The confrontational, satin-robed athlete appears playfully otherworldly, with enlarged wing-tipped spats—a significant precursor to Paschke’s later shoe paintings—that emerge like butterfly wings behind his shoulders. The inscription on his shorts, Our Cover—like the tattoo on his chest, the mask on his face, the baseball mitts that float next to him, and his athletic attire—suggests the social markings used to conceal, protect, and layer a middleclass, middle-American identity.",

Among them was Piet Mondrian, the De Stijl painter who was becoming known for his geometric abstractions. Mondrian invited the young photographer to his studio in early 1926. As Kertész recalled years later: \n\"I went to his studio and instinctively tried to capture in my photographs the spirit of his paintings. He simplified, simplified, simplified. The studio with its symmetry dictated the composition. He had a vase with a flower, but the flower was artificial. It was colored by him with the right color to match the studio.\" \nAlthough Mondrian imposed rigid geometric order on everything in the apartment, Kertész found deviations in the curves of the staircase, vase, and the round boater hat hanging on the rack. (The hat belonged to the photographer’s friend Michel Seuphor, a painter and writer who authored a book on Mondrian, who had accompanied Kertész to the studio.) This photograph has become one of Kertész’s most famous, although it was not published until 1943. It was known previously only through exhibitions, including Kertész’s first exhibition in 1927 at the Parisian gallery Au Sacre du Printemps.",

    "tale" : "John McCracken was a pioneering figure of West Coast Minimalism in the 1960s, when many California artists were concerned with issues of light and color. Having begun his career as a painter, he moved toward a more object-based aesthetic, making abstract works in the form of basic geometric shapes such as cubes or quadratic volumes. In 1966 he developed what became his signature sculptural forms: tall, leaning planks made of wood, coated in fiberglass, and then painted with a highly finished lacquer. Striking in their monolithic simplicity and characterized by pure, monochromatic surfaces, McCracken’s handcrafted “planks,” which rest on the floor and lean against the wall, successfully blur the boundary between painting and sculpture. \nJohn McCracken is considered a Minimalist sculptor with a singularly spiritual bent. He lacquered basic geometric volumes to lustrous effect, and California car culture often motivated his color choices (cars were “mobile color chips,” he once said), but he strove to make objects that were also “hallucinatory” or “other-wordly.” From 1966 forward McCracken’s signature form was the vividly monochrome “plank,” of which Red Plank is a prime example—stately, monolithic, yet leaning casually against the gallery wall.These sleek sculptures exist “between two worlds,” the artist explained, “the floor representing the physical world of standing objects, trees, cars, buildings, human bodies … and the wall representing the world of the imagination, illusionist painting space, [and] human mental space.”",

Once part of a larger grave stele this figure might have accompanied his master in a composition similar to the stele also on view in Gallery 151.",

    "tale" : "Richard Artschwager’s work defies categorization, yet it often combines elements of both Pop Art and Minimalism. An early example of his “furniture surrogates,” which draw upon his experience as the owner of a successful carpentry and furniture-design business, Table with Pink Tablecloth was exhibited— along with other compact, geometric masses wrapped with formica “pictures” so that they resemble domestic items—in his first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, in 1965. Artschwager described this work as “the way a table with a tablecloth is in a painting, in a still life—a three-dimensional still life.” Too short to be useful as a piece of furniture, this translation of a Parsons table depicts a solid form as both mass and void and attempts to reveal the levels of deception involved in pictorial illusionism.",

In the wide fame, angels’ heads alternate with the owner’s arms, mimicking the dust guard or guardapolvos typical of painted altarpieces.

He began to experiment with printmaking around 1915, and by the 1920s, he had found a uniquely American style featuring urban landscapes. A masterful watercolorist, he perfected his evocation of brilliant seaside light while painting the Victorian mansions of Gloucester, Massachusetts.",

This resigned treatment of the crucified Christ gained currency around 1200, in contrast to more upright and triumphant representations of Christ on the cross of earlier centuries.",

    "tale" : "One of the most original literary painters of the mid-19th century, John Quidor frequently drew on the popular tales of the American author Washington Irving, interpreting them with great imagination and a genuine flair for drama. Quidor’s Rip Van Winkle depicts the moment that Rip, awake after his 20-year sleep in the Catskill Mountains, confronts the suspicious townsfolk who do not recognize their long-lost neighbor. Unlike many portrayals of Rip Van Winkle that emphasize his age and confusion, Quidor’s version casts Rip as strong and defiant. Gesturing forcefully at his son (who is slumped against a tree), Rip acts to regain his sense of belonging in a now-unfamiliar world.",

    "tale" : "Nicolas Bertin was primarily a painter of religious, mythological, and allegorical subjects. Although trained in the rigorous French academic traditions, he often emulated the broader style of Titian, Paolo Veronese, and other Venetian Renaissance masters. For his depiction of Christ washing Saint Peter’s feet just after the Last Supper (John 13:4-5), Bertin created a majestic, theatrical backdrop reminiscent of those in Veronese’s pictures. Through gesture and facial expression Bertin adeptly described a range of emotions, from surprise and puzzlement to humility.",

The State Street Bridge, with its characteristic curving ironwork, draws the viewer’s eye into the picture. Clark’s scene is in the tradition of the urban realism of the French Impressionists, recalling such pictures as Claude Monet’s Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare. Like Monet, Clark sought to suggest both the ephemeral nature of fog and smoke and the atmosphere’s effect upon the forms of the city.",

This figure depicts a young male wearing the skin of a sacrificed victim, a primary symbolic aspect of rituals conducted during agricultural fertility ceremonies dedicated to this deity. The lines across the chest represent stitched seams where the skin was fastened. Like living seed within a dried husk, the deity impersonator embodies the relationship between death and the renewal of life.",

    "tale" : "Born of Jewish parents in the Italian coastal town of Leghorn, Amedeo Modigliani settled in Paris in 1906, where he developed friendships with  Pablo Picasso , the poet Max Jacob, the sculptor  Constantin Brancusi, and other members of the literary and artistic avant-garde, many of whom appear in his portraits. He led a notoriously bohemian life, shortened by a self-destructive use of alcohol and drugs. Modigliani produced his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Within a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.In this portrait, Modigliani’s emphasis is on a strong formal structure dominated by the grid in the background and the echoing curves of the sitter’s hat, shoulders, and features. There is none of the pathos often associated with his work. The artist seems instead to have invested this portrait with a note of ironic detachment, even humor, reflected in both the title of the painting (which refers to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France) and the expression of amused inscrutability worn by the sitter. Were painter and sitter perhaps both amused by the flamboyant hat? Modigliani’s skill in rhyming forms, while at the same time keeping us visually interested and slightly off-balance, is evident throughout the picture, which resonates with the lessons of  Paul Cezanne, Cubism, and African sculpture.The sitter for this portrait may well have been Beatrice Hastings, an English poetess who was Modigliani’s mistress at the time. Because of the artist’s tendency to generalize his sitter’s features, however, a comparison of this portrait with others of Hastings is inconclusive.—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 150-151.",

De la nada vida a la nada muerte is the largest of his Running V paintings—a set of large, monochromatic striped pictures whose titles derive from colloquial Spanish expressions. The length and mellifluous sound of this work’s title, which literally means “From life nothing to death nothing,” coincides with the rising and falling visual cadences of the painting. The two-dimensional surface, which appears as if it might continue into infinity, consists of 20 parallel lines and seems to alternately project from and recede into the wall. Although Stella’s rigorously calibrated surface, immaculate execution, and use of monochromatic gold pigment temper this painting, they barely constrain its kinetic exuberance.",

    "tale" : "Until the early 1940s, Franz Kline painted realistic landscapes, portraits, and cityscapes that were inspired by the textures and forms of New York City. Around 1949 he began to make black-and-white canvases such as Painting, which, while abstract, continue to suggest the invigorating energy of urban street life. The artist’s preparation for his paintings included making numerous sketches on newspaper or telephone-book pages. He then translated a small-scale drawing onto canvas, as, what he called, “strokes expanding as entities in themselves.” Utilizing housepainters’ brushes, Kline tacked his canvases to a wood panel in order to obtain the hard surface that he needed to paint his world of eternally colliding forces. Though the many visible drip marks imply a quick, spontaneous execution, the artist returned to this work several times over a two-month period to refine and strengthen its rhythm and spacing.",

The painting was part of Paul Gauguin’s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six Cézannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, “except in a case of direst necessity.” (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.) Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin’s painting style rather than Cézanne’s.",

    "tale" : "While Jasper Johns has worked with stencils of alphabet letters since the 1950s, this is his only painting that shows a single sequence from A to Z. The artist made Alphabet the same year in which he introduced riots of primary color—augmented by touches of green, pink, orange, pale blue, gray, brown, black, and white—into his work. We might try to read this painting in order, letter by letter, from top left to bottom right. But the jumble of strokes, daubs, smudges, and collaged fragments of painted paper scatters our eyes across the animated surface, challenging any sense of sequential progress. In this way, two different stylistic approaches—orderly grids of stenciled forms versus brushy gestures—are set against one another.",

Daley dedicated an untitled sculpture commonly known as \"The Picasso\" in Chicago’s new Civic Center (now the Richard J. Daley Center). Just four years earlier, architect William Hartmann of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill had approached Pablo Picasso with the commission. The artist accepted and crafted two steel maquettes; he kept one in his studio and gave the other to the architect to use in planning. The sculpture’s presence inspired private and public investment in more works for the cityscape over the years, including recent additions in nearby Millennium Park.",

A key figure of American Impressionism, Benson is best known for his outdoor figural compositions—often featuring his wife or children—in sun-filled, breezy landscapes. Rainy Day, in contrast, is a study of the subtler effects of interior light, with flat, overcast lighting filtering in from the left and embers glowing at far right. In the late 19th century, painters including Benson, Edmund Tarbell, and Thomas Wilmer Dewing composed scenes of women in interiors in a contemplative state or engaged in activities like sewing and reading, suggesting links between domesticity, femininity, and cultural refinement.",

In contrast to his iconic, highly constructed portraits, this picture exemplifies a more spontaneous approach in vivid color.

    "tale" : "In 1977 a fire destroyed a vast body of Martin Puryear’s sculpture, as well as many of the artist’s wordly possessions. Resulting in what he called “a period of grieving followed by an incredible lightness andfreedom,” the event proved pivotal in directing the artist’s subsequent work. One year later, Puryear began a series of sculptures around the themes of movement and shelter. Sanctuary embodies what he described as “mobility with a kind of escapism, of survival through flight.” The sculpture appears to be in a state of arrested motion. This whimsical and sophisticated work reconciles a longing for stability with a need for change. By pairing the wild tree saplings with a carefully fashioned shelter, Puryear celebrated the beauty of wood in both its natural and refined states.",

Indeed, saturated and nonreflective coats of color lend her sculptures a strong sense of otherworldliness. “I always call the starting point [for a sculpture] a vision,” she has said. “I’ll be in a tram or driving a car and I suddenly get a picture in my mind. Something completely normal turns into a miracle—something I’ve never seen before. Simple things you see every day turn into something strange, something alien.” Woman with Dog is clearly scaled up— enormously so—from a small figurine made of shells, as one might find in a seaside souvenir shop.\n",

    "tale" : "Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BCE. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire. \nInscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today. \nThe front (obverse) of this coin portrays the head of Julius Caesar facing to the right and wearing a laurel crown. On the back (reverse) are a rudder, globe, cornucopia, caduceus, and apex (priest’s cap).",

    "tale" : "François Boucher, whose art epitomized the light-hearted sensuality of the Rococo style, was the most famous painter and decorator during the reign of Louis XV (r. 1715–74), and was championed by Madame de Pompadour, the king’s powerful mistress. Boucher seldom ventured from major paintings and decorative ensembles to do finished, independent works on paper. Nor did he pursue portraiture, apart from his depictions of royal patrons and members of his family. This engaging and fresh portrait of a boy, perhaps a studio apprentice, may well be one of Boucher’s first, and finest, forays into pastel drawing. With this adaptable and newly fashioned medium, Rococo artists were able to imbue their images with a spirited directness and sense of life. Here Boucher captured the dimple-cheeked lad just as he seems to turn, lips parted as if to speak. The youth’s attentive gaze, tousled hair, and delicately elegant city clothes herald the artist’s suave later manner as court painter. The same young model, again holding a carrot, appears in at least two paintings of pastoral subjects by Boucher.",

    "tale" : "Since the 1990s, New York–based artist Janine Antoni has established an international reputation with labor-intensive projects in a wide range of media. She incorporates both art history and personal exploration, investigating the ways in which contemporary definitions of aesthetics and art making are connected to issues of gender identity and sexuality. Inspired by the feminist artists of the 1970s, she reframes and subverts art-historical and societal conventions surrounding women and beauty.Antoni creates intimate, ritualized encounters between her chosen materials and her own body, which has become her essential tool. In Touch, which was commissioned for SITE Santa Fe in 2002, she balances on a tightrope, a skill she has sought to master. Here, on the beach in front of her childhood home on Grand Bahama Island, the artist walks a line that is parallel to the horizon. Dressed in sky blue, she enters the landscape from outside the frame. When the wire dips under her weight, it appears to touch the horizon, creating the illusion that she is walking on the water. Like many of Antoni’s works, Touch records a relationship—a moment of contact—and reveals the artist’s longing to bridge the gaps between herself and viewers, between her work and art history.Antoni begins with an idea of artistic process that dictates the final result and meaning. The idea of Touch derives from Moor (2001), a work in which the artist created a rope out of her and her friends’ belongings; the artist has said that while she intends to walk it, she also questions the impulse. Touch depicts a literal balancing act in order to suggest the state of perfection that many people strive for, including herself. Antoni has said, “Touch is about that moment or that desire to walk on the horizon,” a location that represents hope and the future. She explained that she wants to walk in “this impossible place, a place that cannot be pinpointed … on the line of my vision, or along the edge of my imagination.” Since the viewer’s involvement is a crucial element in her work, Antoni asks us to imagine ourselves in her situation and contemplate the meaning of the horizon when she is absent from the scene. As the artist teeters but never falls, she accepts and almost embraces a state of imbalance.",

    "tale" : "Hans Memling probably worked with Rogier van der Weyden in Brussels before settling in Bruges in 1465. Van der Weyden was well known for his exquisite devotional diptychs, and Memling was influenced by his work, though he made his paired paintings more realistic by setting the figures in a measurable domestic space. This portrait of the unidentified patron and the image of the Virgin and Child were separated many years ago; they were reunited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. Unfortunately, Portrait of a Man in Prayer is in very poor condition; much better preserved is the image Saint Anthony of Padua, presumably the sitter’s patron saint, on the reverse of the portrait. The saint was painted in subdued tones of gray, in imitation of stone, a convention often used on the backs of Netherlandish altarpieces. Anthony of Padua, an important early follower of Saint Francis, was more popular in Italy, Spain and Portugal than in the Low Countries, hence the diptych may have been made for a member of the large foreign community in Bruges.",

For the chapel in the Paris townhouses of Guillaume Brissonnet, Le Sueur painted the eight Beatitudes, among them the personification of Meekness, as well as an altarpiece of the Annunciation, monochrome scenes of the life of the Virgin, and a ceiling depicting the Assumption of the Virgin. The Beatitudes, with their patterned gold ground, lined the lower story of this elegant ensemble. Only the Annunciation altarpiece and two of the Beatitudes survive. Here the personification of Meekness, appropriately accompanied by a lamb, embodies Christ’s saying in the Sermon on the Mount, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\"",

It was made in Gerard David’s Bruges workshop for export to Spain. Lamentation over the Body of Christ formed the center of a row of narrative scenes supporting the superstructure of the altarpiece following Spanish convention. Parts of the altarpiece are now divided between museums in Washington, D.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Edinburgh, Scotland. In the years around 1500, Gerard David was the leading painter working in Bruges, a Flemish city with a distinguished history as a center of trade and artistic production.",

    "tale" : "Cornell began to make souvenir cases, such as this one, and other objects in tribute to the Romantic ballet in 1940, having begun to collect books, prints, letters, and photographs in the late 1930s. As Lynda Hartigan has pointed out, Cornell was un happy at “not being able to find more poignantly evocative, colorful trifles about its [the Romantic ballet’s] ballerinas,” and used his creations “to fill that void” (Washington, D.C., National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources, 1982–83, exh. cat. by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, p. 36). \nCornell’s infatuation with the great ballet dancers of the past seems to have been no less intense than his devotion to ballerinas of his own time, like Tamara Toumanova. He collected material on Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and the subject of this box, Marie Taglioni. These were the pioneers and stars of the new style of dancing on point in the 1830s and 1840s, which accompanied a dramatic change in ballet, as “mythological and classical themes gave way to plots based on dramatic love themes, fairy tales, and folk legends—themes that treated the subject on two planes: the actual and the ideal, the flesh and the spirit, the real and the fantastic” (Christine Hennessey, “Joseph Cornell: A Balletomane,” Archives of American Art Journal 23, 3 [1983], p. 8). \nCornell, in fact, studied the entire cultural milieu of the Romantic ballet: that in-between world represented by the stage in the nineteenth century, where social and sexual taboos and restrictions were loosened; a world frequented by artists and writers, whose connoisseurs and balletomanes included such figures as the poet Theophile Gautier and the writer Hans Christian Andersen. Cornell devoted an entire issue of Dance Index (4 [Sept. 1945]) to Andersen, including a scenario, “Theatre of Hans Christian Andersen,” for a miniature theater presentation based on his fairy tales. “The Little Mermaid,” for example, is represented in this scenario by the Shadow Dance from Ondine, “the ballet created by Fanny Cerrito a hundred years ago,” Cornell explained, “which was based vaguely upon the Andersen tale” (ibid., p. 158). \nPaper cutouts for miniature shadow theater by Andersen himself are reproduced in this issue (ibid., pp. 138, 144–45, 155–57) with Cornell’s own comments: “And little did these same huge hands dream they were creating in the paper silhouettes priceless pieces of collector’s varia—to enter a precious realm where the white baroque ballerinas invite a paperdoll Taglioni in rainbow costumes to join in their dance to the envious gaze of tiny twin Ellslers [sic] quivering in glass prisons” (ibid., p. 139). \nThe legend inscribed in the lid of Homage to the Romantic Ballet is based on an adventure told by Marie Taglioni of her encounter with a Russian highwayman who blackmailed her into dancing on rugs spread over the muddy road—a story Cornell came across in J. Vandham’s An Englishman in Paris (New York, 1892; see Hennessey, p. 9). The story became entangled in Cornell’s imagination with the chance sight of a load of ice spilling from a truck at New York’s Grand Central Station, which, he said, “evoked in the most graphic manner the faerie of the Romantic ballet” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1066; cited in Hennessey, p. 9). Cornell announced in the October 1940 issue of View (“As We Go to Press,” View 1, 2 [Oct. 1940], p. 4) that he was working on “a box of ice-cubes encased in sumptuous blue velvet … for … Taglioni”; this was the version known as Taglioni’s Jewel Casket now in The Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York 1980 –82, no. 8 7, ill.), which was included in Cornell’s Exhibition of Objects at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York, in December of 1940. One of the categories or work noted on the exhibition announcement was “Homage to the Romantic Ballet: Marie Taglioni, Fanny Cerrito, Calotta Grisi, etc.” The casket was purchased from this exhibition by James Thrall Soby, who gave it to The Museum or Modern Art in 1953. Taglioni‘s Jewel Casket has two necklaces, one of which is suspended inside the lid, in addition to sparkling glass gems, purchased from Woolworth’s. In both boxes Cornell pasted the legend of the encounter between the ballerina and the highwayman, typed in light letters on a dark ground, so that even the text‘s appearance contributes to the atmosphere of a moonlit night. Cornell’s version of the event, as Dickran Tashjian suggested, contains a “barely suppressed eroticism,” which points to the “sexual charge of his ballet imagery” (Tashjian 1992, p. 113). \nThe evidence provided by the box itself indicate that Homage to the Romantic Ballet originally included twelve smaller cubes. There are in fact markings on the velvet lining in the lid of the box suggesting that it once contained twelve 1-inch cubes, and the lid cannot be closed while the present 1 1\/4-inch cubes are on the glass because they are too large. \n— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 45-47.",

    "tale" : "Beginning in 1917, Henri Matisse spent most winters in the southern French city of Nice. The warm light there transformed the artist’s work profoundly, leading him to comment: \"If I had painted in the north … my painting would have been different. There would have been browns, grays, shadings of color through perspective.\" Painted during one of his sojourns to Nice, this picture’s challenging spatial construction, palpable paint texture, and patterned background recall the still lifes of Paul Cezanne. The artist was especially on Matisse’s mind when he began this composition in 1926: the same year, Matisse’s dealer staged a posthumous retrospective of over 50 of Cézanne’s major works.",

The long, horizontal canvas conveys a striking sense of the region’s panoramic views. The brilliant Southwestern light offered O’Keeffe immense visual clarity over many miles, and she translated her perception of distant geological formations—particularly the dark green mesa that dominates the top third of the composition—into an arrangement of stacked bands of color.",

Buoy was one of three works he completed upon his return to Pennsylvania. Blume spoke of the buoys he viewed in Florida: They’d put out these bright red balls, and inside of three or four weeks they’d be covered with … all sorts of odd growths … I watched them stripping this stuff off and getting to the red thing again … I saw these balls, great big buoys, as a form of the earth and the laceration down to the red thing as a sort of bleeding world going on.",

    "tale" : "The Yoruba of Nigeria have the highest recorded rate of twin births in the world, with an estimated 45 sets of twins in every 1,000 births. For Yoruba families, the birth of twins is greeted with rejoicing because they are believed to possess special powers and the ability to bring good fortune to those who honor them properly. However, multiple births have an increased risk of one of the twins dying during infancy. Figures like these, called ibeji, are memorials to deceased twins. Their elaborate hairstyles and beaded jewelry mark their honored status. When one twin dies, a single sculpture is commissioned and cared for by the mother and later by the surviving twin. If both infants die, a sculptor creates two images. The figures are ritually washed, dressed, and offered favorite foods. Such figures reflect the various styles of individual artists and regions. The heads of the pair from the Oyo region have been repeatedly bathed with indigo, symbolizing the calming of the spirit’s inner being.— Descriptive text",

The incised lines covering its surface mimic body scarification, and it was originally colored with pigments. These massive sculptures are worn by young men in entertainment masquerades that celebrate Baga ethnicity. In the late 1950s Baga art traditions and related religious practices were temporarily abandoned due to the introduction of Islam into the region and the “demystification” campaign of Guinea’s first president. The country achieved independence in 1958 after the Islamic Revolution of 1954–57, and this national program was aimed at purging traditional religion of its essential mysticism. In practice, demystification led to persecution and the massive destruction of ritual art. Baga culture and art was subsequently revived in the late 1980s.",

In contrast to Newman and Rothko, who usually applied paint thinly and uniformly, Still used a palette knife, creating textural effects that give the surface a complex, nearly sculptural sense of materiality. Named after the years of its creation, 1951–52 is a rare, nearly all-black work in the artist’s oeuvre. A vertical white line to the right of center and a thin streak of red-orange along the left side provide the sole interruptions in the black field. The subtle modulations of texture and finish support the artist’s claim that \"I do not oversimplify—in fact, I revel in the extra complex.\"",

Morris Kantor, a Russian-born immigrant, was inspired by the colonial houses he encountered during summers in New England. Here he painted the living room of an early American house, yet his rendering takes on a suggestion of Surrealism through his inclusion of ominous black shadows—in the shape of a ghostly figure at the right—that encroach upon the room. Kantor depicted the surrounding houses in the inky depths of these forms, bringing the dark night into the brightly lit room. Their presence transforms a nostalgic interior into a space of mystery and uncertainty.",

An ardent amateur musician, he depicted musical subjects throughout his career. In the late 1920s he began listening to music while painting and simultaneously initiated a series of works on forms of popular music such as jazz and swing. Swing Music (Louis Armstrong) celebrates the renowned jazz trumpeter, who, in the 1930s, led swing-style orchestras. For Dove this topic was especially attractive because it evoked the dynamism characteristic of 20th-century life. Its specifically American nature made it an ideal subject for the native modernism that Dove and the other artists from the circle of Alfred Stieglitz sought to establish. Stieglitz exhibited this painting at his gallery An American Place.",

Jacob Cornelisz. was the first major painter established in Amsterdam; the importance of this city in the northern portion of the Netherlands increased dramatically over the course of the 16th century.",

    "tale" : "Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the development of modern architecture. Operating on a principle of “less is more,” he utilized materials such as industrial steel and plate glass in his strikingly minimal designs, which are notably free of decorative forms. As director of the German Bauhaus during the early 1930s, Mies formalized his notion of unifying form with function. In 1937 he immigrated to Chicago, where he became director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology (later the Illinois Institute of Technology). His legacy is still felt in the school’s program of stressing the fundamentals, materials, and function of architectural design. This Court House Study depicts a vast, open interior in which two slender columns provide the only visible means of support. The wide-angle perspective emphasizes the building’s strong horizontal character. A nearly seamless wall of glass fills living areas with light and dissolves the boundary between interior and exterior.",

    "tale" : "Although he was trained in the tradition of his Florentine master, Andrea del Sarto (1486–1530), Pontormo created more expressive and experimental works than the older artist. His portraits are noted for their penetrating insight into character. The subject of this painting, the emotionally unstable Alessandro de’ Medici, was probably an illegitimate son of Pope Clement VII by a Moorish slave. Alessandro was named the first Duke of Florence in 1532, after the defeat of the city’s republican government by an alliance of the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Alessandro’s tyrannical reign ended in 1537, when he was assassinated by his cousin. This appears to be a preliminary painting of the duke that Pontormo consulted in the creation of a larger format state portrait now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",

After he returned to the United States, Stella used Futurism to convey the dynamism of American industry in paintings such as By-Products Plants, which depicts the factories that extract ammonia, tar, and light oils when coal is burned. Such mechanical processes fascinated Stella, and he later recalled, “opposite my studio was a huge factory … towering with the gloom of a prison. At night fires gave to innumerable windows menacing blazing looks of demons.” Stella invested his factory paintings with this sense of eerie mystery.",

It is decorated in relief with a scene taken from the life of the Greek mythical hero Meleager, who led the hunt for a wild boar that was terrorizing the people of Calydon. Here the valiant hunter stands in the center, his right foot resting on a rock. He is surrounded by his companions, including Herakles at the far left, who is armed with his distinctive knobby club, and his beloved, Atalanta (now headless), seated on the right. Meleager’s head resembles portraits of Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.), the Macedonian king and general who conquered Asia as far east as the Indus River, perhaps because the Romans equated success in the hunt with victory on the battlefield. It is possible that the owner of this sarcophagus wished to equate his bravery and achievements with those of both Meleager and Alexander.",

    "tale" : "A pioneering figure in electronic art, Nam June Paik was among the first to use television as an art form. Originally a composer of experimental and electronic music, he created performance work within the context of the Fluxus movement in the 1950s. The artist viewed his musical instruments as “objects with visual qualities,” which allowed him to move fluidly from using sound to incorporating images into his creations. Having begun exhibiting works with televisions in 1963, Paik was one of the earliest artists to use a Sony Portapak (the first portable video recording device) after it became available in 1965, producing his initial multimonitor video sculptures the following year.Family of Robot, the first series of video sculptures that Paik created, consists of three generations of family members, including a grandmother and grandfather; mother and father; aunt and uncle; and children. Paik pursued the theme of generational difference through his choice of materials, providing a unified history of family and technology. Viewed as a whole, this group of anthropomorphic sculptures incorporates media hardware from various stages of its evolution in the twentieth century. The grandparents’ heads are constructed of 1930s radios and their bodies of 1940s television frames refitted with Sony or Quasar screens, while the parents’ heads are more recent than their bodies. The children, including Baby, are made of newer televisions. In some cases, the children’s heads are two decades more advanced than their bodies, and in others, both sections are made of uniform parts. The Art Institute’s Baby—one of nine unique baby robots—was assembled from thirteen Samsung monitors, which at the time were the most up-to-date equipment manufactured in Korea. The monitors are placed in different directions in the aluminum armature, depending on the section of the body they represent.In Family of Robot, television is used not as a means of disseminating information but rather as a more decorative element. Like its relatives, Baby displays an artist-created videotape—in this case, one that consists of flashing, vibrant images of hearts, psychedelic patterns, revolving bands and planets, and excerpts of newscasts depicting people, especially children, in Africa and India. Paik insisted that a balance should exist between nature and technology, a notion that he realized in this friendly looking figure, which is a remarkable product of his own time and effort.With this series, Paik suggested that technology is both a product of human innovation and a potential cause of our retreat from reality. In a sense, he explicitly humanized technology as a means of resistance, commenting, “One must … know technology very well in order to be able to overcome it.” Stating that the purpose of video art is “to liberate people from the tyranny of TV,” he was perhaps reminding us of the capability of technology—or, more specifically, of broadcast television—to consume our lives, and asserting the need for us to see it in a different form, such as art. Although Baby’s televisions are now dated themselves, this obsolescence only enhances the work’s ability to evoke the rapid transformation of technology.",

    "tale" : "Chicagoan Archibald Motley attended the School of the Art Institute at a time when many prominent art academies denied entrance to African American students. His affiliation with the school was thus of great significance to him. Around 1920, as a recent graduate, he painted a self-portrait meant to introduce him as a poised young artist, elegantly presenting himself in a dark suit jacket, crisp white shirt, and a dark tie accented by a diamond horseshoe pin. Furthermore, Motley painted this work following race riots in July 1919, which had heightened tensions in Chicago. The violence convinced him that he should use his art to influence perceptions of African Americans in a positive manner. This sophisticated self-portrait is thus an extraordinary declaration of his goals and ambitions.",

    "tale" : "Andrew Wyeth often sought to capture his emotional response to an intriguing place by honing, refining, and crystallizing his initial impressions into hushed, haunting final compositions. The Cloisters depicts a small, empty room at the Ephrata Cloister, located near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles from Wyeth’s home in Chadds Ford. It was the seat of the German Seventh-day Baptists, an early American religious colony that had disbanded in 1934 and was being restored as a historic landmark when Wyeth visited with his aunt Elizabeth in 1949. Wyeth’s early studies portrayed Elizabeth in the room, but he eliminated her figure and increasingly abstracted the space to focus on the play of light against the muted brown walls. The bird, a chalk sculpture of the type produced by residents of the Ephrata Cloister, stands as a slightly surreal evocation of the history of the colony and Elizabeth’s one-time presence in the scene.",

The church, the carefully tended fields, and the hayrick on the right are all finely delineated in a manner typical of Inness’s early style. Although the artist’s reverent handling of color and light in this image has often been linked to his interest in Swedenborgian spirituality, it also relates to his admiration for this particular expanse of the American landscape. During the mid-19th century, the Catskill Mountain range was America’s premiere tourist site. The region’s close proximity to urban centers and abundant spectacular views made the Catskills a popular destination for those who wanted to escape from the bustle of modern life.",

Although Katz’s insistence on figuration initially placed him outside the contemporary avant-garde mainstream, in which abstraction dominated, his inventive resolution of the demands of formalism and representation responded to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and eventually established him as a leader of the new figurative tradition in painting. Often featuring his wife, family, and friends as portrait subjects, his works emphasize the flatness of the picture plane while remaining determinedly realistic, resulting in highly stylized images that appear at once specific and generic. This painting shows Katz’s son, Vincent, with his boyhood friend Tony.",

He depicted El Salto Peak ringed with clouds and flooded the valley below with light, creating shimmering atmospheric effects with his vibrant palette. As the artist once observed, “A field or a mountain is always changing. They change size and color with every passing cloud and with the passing of every hour and season.” Higgins studied and taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He first went to Taos, New Mexico, in 1914, sponsored by a group of Chicagoans who wanted to support local artists. Liberated from financial concerns, Higgins experimented boldly with modern form and color."

    "tale" : "Homer’s exploration of life and death in the tropics found ultimate expression in his oil painting The Gulf Stream painted at Prout’s Neck following his return from the Bahamas. A group of four watercolors documents the evolution of this terrifying seascape, which details the plight of a solitary black man, adrift in stormy seas on a broken boat and encircled by a school of aggressive requiem sharks. In early 1885, on his first trip to the Bahamas, Homer had painted Shark Fishing which depicts two fishermen controlling a hooked shark that struggles, mouth open, in the immediate foreground. On this same trip, the artist executed a similar subject, Sharks (The Derelict). In this work, an unmanned wooden boat, broken-masted and taking on water, is under attack by at least three large, circling animals. The fact that the boat is empty leaves the viewer to wonder if the worst has already happened.Homer’s 1898 voyage to the Bahamas must have reminded him of these works, suggesting the idea for his next major painting. Either in Nassau, or more likely after he returned to Prout’s Neck, he developed the theme in two watercolors. One is Study for “The Gulf Stream”, a detailed view of the bow of the derelict boat that corresponds closely to the final painting. In the work, the artist trimmed a horizontal sheet into a vertical format and filled it nearly to the top with churning waves. In the Art Institute’s watercolor study The Gulf Stream, Homer positioned the shark so that it appears to swim over the submerged side of the boat. It is probable that he painted this work in his Prout’s Neck studio, where he would have been able to refer to the studies from 1885. He trimmed the bottom of The Gulf Stream sheet, forcing the belly of the shark right up against the picture plane. In both this watercolor and in the finished painting, the impassive (or dazed) expression of the castaway and his surprisingly relaxed (or resigned) pose imbue the subject with ambiguity.",

In Untitled fragments of natural canvas and burlap are tautly stretched and attached with wire to an armature and welded framework. Every element seems directed toward the deep, velvet-lined opening, which suggests geographic and biological references, such as a volcano, a black hole, or an anatomical orifice. Untitled was originally exhibited in the artist’s one-person exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York; Bontecou was one of only two women given one-person exhibitions there during this period.",

Instead of using various brushes to create a beautifully crafted and refined surface, Pissarro loaded his paint on heavily, often with a palette knife, in emulation of Gustave Courbet. The subject, an empty rural winter landscape, is resolutely unpicturesque and purposefully devoid of the great oaks and ancient ruins of traditional Salon landscapes."

He did not adhere to one particular artistic style, though he admired earlier artists like Rembrandt and Jean-Siméon Chardin and the more recent Fauves and Expressionists. In the mid-1920s, Soutine produced a group of still-life paintings primarily featuring hanging game and meat carcasses, subjects found in European art for centuries. Rather than depicting the dead animals as lifeless and limp, however, he often portrayed them as tragic figures; in works like Dead Fowl, the visceral quality of the thick, swirling paint suggests the bird’s writhing battle against death.",

    "tale" : "Along with Impressionist painters Claude Monet and Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro pursued the theme of snow throughout his career, producing nearly 100 “snow” paintings. In 1879 France experienced an extraordinarily severe winter, which Pissarro explored in this and other works painted at his home in Pontoise, 30 miles west of Paris, along the Seine River. In Rabbit Warren, snow covers the ground, houses, and vegetation in a frothy coat that resulted from the artist’s vigorous brushwork. Throughout, small spots of color in the chimneys, greenish shrubs, and clothing of the man at right punctuate what is otherwise a predominately yellowish white and uninhabited fragment of nature.",

Depicted against a dark background with only his palette and brushes to indicate his profession, he looks at the viewer as if caught unawares. The unseen easel and canvas must be located immediately in front of the artist and to our left. \nDuring his brief career, which ended when he was killed in the line of duty during the Franco-Prussian War, Frédéric Bazille produced about 70 paintings, 4 of them self-portraits. He created this work while sharing an apartment-studio with Claude Monet and experimenting with new painting techniques that would be central to the Impressionist movement. It was both a practice piece (in which Bazille observed and painted his reversed image as seen in a mirror) and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.",

Composed of wax, which Smith favors for its malleability, Blood Pool evokes the texture and color of flesh. Although the point of departure for her pieces is literal—she always works from casts of live models—the figure, with its fetal pose and exposed spine, becomes a primal emblem that engages viewers in issues of individual and collective health and disease, heroization and victimization, and life and death (particularly because of the dual potential of human blood in the era of AIDS).",

Characteristic of Ochtervelt, however, are the angled poses and the playful interchange between the figures. The girl holds a violin, an instrument more often played by men, and points authoritatively to the music score in an ironic reversal of the roles of the sexes.",

    "tale" : "Romare Bearden based this work on Pintoricchio’s Italian Renaissance fresco titled The Return of Odysseus, using collage to bring various physical attributes inspired by Benin masks and sculptures into the classic Greek scene. This work is based on a scene in Homer’s The Odyssey, in which Odysseus finally returns home to find that he has been presumed dead and that suitors have been trying to take Penelope, his wife, as theirs. Disguised as a pauper, Odysseus convinces Penelope that she should hold a contest to see which of the many suitors can manage her husband’s bow. Through this competition he regains her hand in marriage. \nIn making this collage, Bearden sought to draw a link between Odysseus’s struggles and those of all African Americans. Bearden was the leader of “Spiral,” a group of artists based in Harlem committed to the advancement of African Americans during the Civil Rights movement. Benin gained independence from French rule in 1960, less than twenty years before this collage was made. By making the faces of the characters black instead of white as in the original fresco, Bearden endeavored to draw comparisons between the struggles of the Benin people and African Americans, and used the Greek epic to underscore the commonalities of all humans.",

The artist used the Rubaiyat to express his own philosophical beliefs regarding such metaphysical and spiritual questions as death and the existence of an afterlife, subjects that are at the core of Khayyam’s poetry. This image depicts the three Fates of Greek mythology—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos—working the thread of life. Clotho spins the thread, Lachesis fixes its length, and Atropos cuts it at the appointed time of death. The Fates are symbolized by the spindle, distaff, and shears in the foreground and represent the poet’s belief that mankind has no control over destiny.",

Promoting the elimination of the picturesque in favor of mathematical order and logic, Purist artists, including Fernand Léger, sought to represent the modern, \"universal\" forms of the world—especially machine-made objects—in a precise and balanced way as part of their effort to promote a new, modern classicism. Despite the generally smooth, brushless style of Purist pictures, Still Life Filled with Space has an unusual amount of brushwork and texture, notably in the patterned border, which the artist made by dragging a comblike tool repeatedly through the wet white paint."

Cage and Arp encouraged Kelly to involve chance in his compositional arrangements, as Arp had done in Dadaist collages as early as 1916, and as Cage began to do in musical compositions in 1951. \nProduced in 1951, Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance was the basis for Cité, a large-scale polyptych painting, and served as the foundation for a period of Kelly’s career in which his work was characterized by gridded compositions developed at random through a collage process. \nThe inspiration for Cité’ came to Kelly in a dream in June 1951, while he was staying at the Cité Universitaire, a large complex of buildings that included dormitories for the University of Paris. He wrote, “I dreamt that I was working on a scaffold … creating an immense mural composed of square panels on which we painted black bands with huge brushes.” [1] With the dream came an “idea for a very grand work, something to be used with architecture… . This dream is something I have been waiting for.” [2] To replicate the qualities of the dream painting, Kelly produced Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance. Kelly brushed ink strokes across a sheet of paper, cut the resulting drawing into twenty squares, and randomly recomposed the drawing by shuffling the squares before he glued them onto a support in a grid pattern, retaining the horizontal orientation of the brushstrokes. Cité, [3] now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, replicates Study for “Cité” as a polyptych painting. \n[1] Kelly, Ellsworth, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement, and Yve-Alain Bois, Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948–1954 (National Gallery of Art, 1992), p. 190.[2] Bois, Yve-Alain, and Ellsworth Kelly, Ellsworth Kelly: The Early Drawings, 1948–1955 (Harvard University Art Museums, 1999), p. 24.[3] 148.59 cm × 179.71 cm × 5.08 cm",

    "tale" : "This painting dates to one of the most productive and inventive periods of Pablo Picasso’s career, a summer stay in the town of Horta de Ebro (now Horta de San Juan) in Spain, which lasted, with minor interruptions, from May to September of 1909. During these months, Picasso produced a series of landscapes, heads, and still lifes that are among the most highly acclaimed achievements of early Cubism. Picasso’s companion, Fernande Olivier, was the model for the series of heads that the artist produced at this time.In this painting, the contrast between the naturalistic still life in the background and the boldly faceted figure in the foreground illustrates an important stage in Picasso’s evolution at the time. A series of still lifes by Picasso that were inspired by the art of Paul Cezanne preceded Picasso’s powerful probing into the nature of solid form, which is exemplified here by the treatment of the head. By vigorously modeling the form in a manner that blatantly disregards the rules of illusionistic painting, Picasso conveyed information about the subject’s underlying structure, about its development in the round (Olivier’s bun, for example, which would normally not be visible from the front, is brought into full view), and a remarkably tactile sense of its projections and recessions. Not surprisingly, these highly sculptural portraits led Picasso to turn, as he did intermittently throughout his career, to actual sculpture upon his return to Paris in the autumn of 1909. The result was the head of Fernande Olivier, an early bronze cast of which is in the Art Institute. In this sculpture, Picasso combined the faceting of the face seen in our painting with the scalloped treatment of the hair found in a drawing from this same period, which is also in the collection of the Art Institute. The artist then energized the head through a dynamic torsion of the neck, replacing the relaxed, fleshy folds in the painting with an emphasis on the taut curve of the back of the neck, as the head bends and twists in space. Although Cubism was to exert an enormous influence on the move toward abstraction among many artists in the early part of this century, Fernande Olivier reminds us that Cubism itself was firmly rooted in an intense study of material reality.This painting was once in the famed collection of expatriates Leo and Gertrude Stein in Paris, and can in fact be seen hanging on the wall of Gertrude Stein’s study in a photograph of 1914-15. \n—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 138-139.",

    "tale" : "In the American Southwest, there is an Indian ceramic tradition that began to take form in the early centuries A.D. and has continued unbroken to the present time. Characterized by its many superbly varied styles, the art has been sustained by diverse Pueblo peoples and some of their neighbors, whose ancient and more recent settlements have long been established in the arid regions of Arizona and New Mexico. Ceramic artist of the Ácoma Pueblo, west of Albuquerque, produced an especially distinguished series of vessels during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.This large, rounded, and beautifully proportioned vessel is covered by exuberant, colorful figures representing macaws and other birds, double rainbows, flowers, and plants. The fluid, lively pattern breaks from the disciplined, abstract symmetry that widely prevails in Puebloan tradition, possibly reflecting the influence of designs from Mexico or perhaps the printed or embroidered textiles from the eastern United States that reached New Mexico beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. Nevertheless, traditional indigenous perceptions remained in play, for macaws have been featured for centuries in Puebloan rituals devoted to the sun, rain, and agricultural fertility, as shown in corresponding ceramic and mural imagery. In this context the rainbows, flowers, and the sense of thriving life also faithfully adhere to an ancient and ongoing theme of communal participation in nature’s eternal renewal.",

    "tale" : "John Singer Sargent was an internationally renowned portrait painter who also executed several mural commissions, including a series on the history of religion for the Boston Public Library (1890–1919). He traveled to Egypt in 1891 in search of source material and inspiration, drawn to the Middle East, like many of his contemporaries, by the region’s perceived exoticism and its ancient histories. Sargent painted this full-length figure study of an anonymous woman in a studio in Cairo. Instead of using the bravura painterly style of swift, visible brushstrokes that characterizes his society portraits, Sargent returned to his academic training, carefully modeling the woman’s form and flesh tones. She assumes a complicated pose, placing her weight on her right foot while twisting her upper body to the left. Life Study was widely exhibited, including at the Salon du Champs de Mars in Paris in 1892 and the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.",

    "tale" : "Gerard Terborch specialized in small-scale portraits and scenes of everyday life, now known as genre scenes. His interiors provide an evocative setting for figures absorbed in the rituals of everyday life, with distracting domestic furniture kept to a minimum. His mature genre paintings deal with “high-life” subjects: officers and elegant young women conversing, making music, or exchanging letters. Here a lady plays an elaborate stringed instrument, the double-headed lute, while her companion marks the tempo for her. He is presumably her music master, but, as is typical for Terborch, the precise relationship of the figures remains tantalizingly ambiguous.",

    "tale" : "Auguste Rodin’s sculpture Eve owes its genesis to The Gates of Hell, the artist’s major commission from the French government in 1880. The associations posed by the sculptural portals of that project led Rodin back to the art of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Michelangelo, particularly their depiction of biblical stories from the book of Genesis. A number of elements from the Gates—such as The Thinker, Adam, and Eve—gradually evolved into independent works. In particular, Eve recalls the most sculptural of Renaissance paintings: Michelangelo’s panels from the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and Masaccio’s Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Its naturalism shocked critics when it was first exhibited, since Eve seemed to them more like a flesh-and-blood woman than an idealized creation.",

    "tale" : "By the 1970s, Roy Lichtenstein’s comic-book style of painting had become his trademark. While he had adapted his early compositions from actual comic books, here Lichtenstein rather referred to an art historical rather than a pop culture source: Henri Matisse’s Red Studio (1911; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which features Matisse’s canvases casually set around a room. Into this flattened studio space Lichtenstein similarly inserted whole or partial versions of his own real and imagined artworks across a range of subject matter, including geometric abstraction. This painting’s title calls out the 1962 print Foot Medication, reimagined as a monumental painting at upper left. This kind of self-quotation, at once playful and thoughtful, would become another feature of Lichtenstein’s production.\n",

Hemmed in by the monolithic concrete riverbank, with an industrial landscape in the distance, the natural flow of water seems controlled and possibly reshaped. The expressions of the three women standing in the foreground are concealed from the viewer, contributing to the sense of ambiguity created by the vivid contrast between the natural and man-made landscapes. Commenting on The River, one critic noted that Guglielmi “interprets the relationship of man to his city environment. Often more profound than social consciousness, his work somehow suggests the theme of man oppressed by his own great triumphs.”",

Degas gleaned from the Baroque master his capacity to create an atmosphere from which a convincing presence emerges. \nThis probing self-appraisal was made when the artist was only twenty-three years old. The maturity of Degas’s gaze is matched by the sophistication of his technique. He has printed this etching with a personalized, rich wiping of the plate that anticipates his later work in monotypes.",

On the other, less-favored side of the cross are Christ’s condemners and the cynics who rejected him, among them the soldiers who cast dice to divide up his clothing. Although Lucas Cranach the Elder was a friend of Martin Luther and a firm supporter of the Reformation, his highly successful workshop produced altarpieces for both Protestant and Catholic patrons. In this painting, probably used as an altarpiece, the artist does not take a stand in the doctrinal struggle that grew out of Luther’s preaching and writing beginning in 1517.",

A scene of a small grove of trees backlit by an intense sunset, the painting exuberantly evokes the brilliant color of the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). The artist applied bold streaks of pigment using fluid brushstrokes, drawing attention to the paint’s texture. Paintings such as Twilight inspired the acclaimed Harlem Renaissance author Alain Locke to praise the young artist: “Mr. Woodruff paints landscapes of originality,” with a “warm beauty” of color. Woodruff later became a highly influential muralist and educator, dedicated to promoting the works and careers of African American artists.",

The figures in this work are only partly freed from the marble, a technique that emphasizes the mass and outline of the stone.

Baer was primarily interested in using painting as a vehicle for exploring the complexities of visual perception. From 1963 to 1975, she limited her \"imagery\" to bands of black combined with colors at the edges of the canvas as a means of emphasizing the essential, objectlike qualities of painting.",

In works such as Boats at Rest, he depicted locales around his native Ipswich, Massachusetts, using the radical cropping, elevated perspective, and flattened pictorial space characteristic of ukiyo-e (Japanese woodblock) prints. His palette of bold colors, however, is more akin to the work of French Post-Impressionist artists such as Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. Dow’s Japanese-inspired theories of composition, which he outlined both in his publications and in the classes he taught at the Ipswich Summer School of Art and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, were immensely influential to artists and designers working in both two and three dimensions.",

    "tale" : "This handled cup was likely used as part of the Greek symposium. Much like modern academic symposiums, in which people discuss a topic of common interest, debunking old theories and putting forth new hypotheses; the men of ancient Athens regularly got together in private homes to exchange ideas. Afterward the participants might continue the conversation, discussing their impressions in greater detail or simply socializing over a drink. As the evening progressed, participants engaged in other pleasures, including games, performances, and sex. \nWine played a major role in fueling these evenings, and as such the myriad vessels used in the symposium often paid homage to drink. Here Dionysos, the god of wine and theater, is shown riding a donkey who’s exaggerated physical arousal would have appealed to the ancient Greeks’ often bawdy sense of humor. The god is accompanied by his female companions, known as maenads, who were notorious for the kind of ecstatic, freewheeling dances they perform here.",

Pollock became engaged in an intense dialogue with the work of the Mexican muralists José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros; he was inspired by their social commitment and use of primitive, archetypal imagery. The expressionistic style and oblong format of Untitled recall Orozco’s murals at Pomona and Dartmouth Colleges, which Pollock had seen firsthand. The bullfight imagery evokes the work of Pablo Picasso, whose Guernica (1937) made a powerful impression on Pollock when he saw the painting in New York in 1939.",

Number 19 follows the characteristic format of his multiform paintings, in which loosely defined organic shapes hover over a thinly brushed background. Whereas color once assumed a supporting role in his compositions, by this period, color had become a defining force, thus marking the transition from Rothko’s early work to his mature, color-field paintings.",

The muscular, yet lean and attenuated figure rests lightly on the balls of his feet, with his head tucked down and arm raised. The artist later recalled that the boxer “moved like a ballet dancer,” and this sculpture conveys the immense strength and surprising delicacy of that movement with lyricism and grace.",

Others, including Joan Miró, embraced it as a venue for new creative possibilities. In addition to designing theater sets, backdrops, and costumes, Miró was involved in the decorative arts. This painting, titled Painting (Figures with Stars), is one of four cartoons for tapestries commissioned in 1933 by the French art collector and gallery director Marie Cuttoli. Two of Miró’s designs, including this one, were made into tapestries at the famous French Aubusson tapestry works.",

    "tale" : "No artist has probed the potential of self-portraiture with greater tenacity and variety than Rembrandt. Over the course of his long career, he made over 80 self-portraits in oil, in chalk, in pen and ink and wash, and in etching. A large portion of these self-examinations were created while he was a young man, and served to spread his fame, his name and image, while advertising his abilities in portraiture and dramatic expression. But perhaps Rembrandt’s most soul-searching and moving images date from the end of his career, characteristically, his self-scrutiny was first considered carefully in etching, before being pursued in painting. \nUnpretentious, the image Self Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate reflects a traditional portrait type used since the 15th century. Not striking a pose, the artist is caught in the middle of his most intimate and natural activity, etching on a plate resting on a folded piece of cloth on top of several books. In this particularly fine impression of the finished print, Rembrandt’s gaze rivets the viewer with a soul-searching energy that seems capable of fueling his late, great painted investigations. \nNoted Rembrandt scholar Mariët Westermann has observed \"by its sheer extent, his portraiture production inaugurated a type of pictorial autobiography… including diaries, memoirs, and philosophical investigations\" reflective of \"the new valuation of the individual…underpinned by the Protestant Reformation.\"[1] Philosopher René Descartes published his famous treatise on ‘the nature of the human self’ (‘I think, therefore I am’) in Rembrandt’s native Leiden in 1637. Westermann has conjectured that \"Rembrandt’s incessant representation of his face and body suggests a Cartesian belief in the actuality and relevance of the self.\"[2] \nWhen Rembrandt created Self-Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate, in 1648, it had been nine years since his last major self-portrait etching, the arrogant and famous Self Portrait Leaning on a Sill of 1639, which echoed the Renaissance courtier portraits of Raphael and Titian. The reasons for this significant hiatus have been cause for speculation by various Rembrandt scholars. It had been a time of great turmoil for the artist: his son Titus was born in 1641, but in 1642 his beloved Saskia had died; Nursemaid Geertge Dircx’s insistence on marriage led to lawsuits throughout the decade, resulting in her incarceration. Finally the comforting companionship of Hendrickje Stoffels, introduced to the household about 1648, restored balance to Rembrandt’s life. Christopher White remarked on Rembrandt’s general reluctance to look at himself during the decade of the 1640s.[3] Perry Chapman suggested that Rembrandt’s sudden interest in landscape, about 1640, \"coincided with his suspension of self-portrayal… the solitude of nature served as a alternative form of self-examination.\"[4] \nCreated just a year after the subtle and elegantly individual etched portraits of Jan Six and Ephraim Bonus of 1647, this self-portrait seems more sober and much more introspective. Wearing a plain black hat with high crown and simple studio tunic, the artist seems less gracious and slightly obdurate. Despite appearances, Rembrandt has not yet encountered sobering financial difficulties. It is worth noting that 1639, the year of that aggrandizing earlier self-portrait, was the year in which Rembrandt contracted to purchase his expensive house on the Sint Antonisbreestraat for 13,000 guilders. In 1647, his and Saskia’s marital estate had been estimated at 40,750 guilders, and the precipitous decline of his fortunes would not be apparent for several years. Therefore, Christopher White suggests \"his new introspective mood must have been prompted by personal and artistic reasons, which must have inspired the magic of psychological interpretation. Earlier he had depicted himself from the outside inviting us to be his spectators, but now he studies himself from within, and we feel ourselves intruders in this frank and intimate self-analysis in a mirror, in which one is as near to reading the mind as is humanly possible in a visual medium. The look is piercingly powerful and we see the man himself and not his expression.\"[5] \nErik Hinterding noted that the image is built up less with lines than from a range of shades,[6] not unlike the elaborate gradations achieved in the portraits of Six and Bonus, or Rembrandt’s contemporary masterpiece, Christ Preaching, known as The Hundred Guilder Print. Thanks to eight known examples of the unfinished first state,[7] it is possible to study Rembrandt’s working method in creating such a complex medley of intaglio processes. He seems to have used etching to lay in the subject with a dense network of lines, but relied on drypoint to define the forms, and tiny flecks to suggest the face. Indeed, the lines of the visage may not have fully printed until the finished second state, in which in other areas he used a combination of etching, drypoint and engraving so well blended that no single method is easily apparent [8] Rembrandt even used the engraver’s burin to shade his left hand so that the cuff is highlighted, and a fine line of drypoint to outline the right arm and the window. \nIn this second state, which Rembrandt finally deemed to be ready to go out into the world, he added a scrim of cloth at the top of the window on which he inscribed his name—an apt reminder of how important light always was for him as an artist, as well as how critical it was for him to be able to modulate the light in his workshop. Christopher White has said \"in signing it, he must have been aware that he had completed one of the key works of this period of his life… though he made two more self-portraits in etching, this is undoubtedly the greatest and most searching. From now on, this analysis was to be seen in the moving series of painted self-portraits….\"[9] \nRembrandt made only minor corrections of additional burin work in the third state. In the fourth state the foul-biting apparent in the open window has been transformed into a landscape. Scholars are divided as to the authenticity of this landscape, but there is no question that the fifth state, already very dry and worn, is posthumous.10] \n[1] Mariët Westermann, Rembrandt, London, 2000, pp. 9–11.[2] Op cit., p. 13.[3] Christopher White, Rembrandt as an Etcher, London, 1969, p. 132.[4] H.

Characterized by lyrical brushwork and biomorphic abstractions, these works marked the artist’s shift from a figurative drawing style, largely influenced by Arshile Gorky and other European artists, to the evolving gestural tradition of the New York School. Having eliminated color from his palette at that moment, de Kooning became more spontaneous with his application of paint, pushing his compositions to the edge of the paper. The resulting works embodied the physical act of painting, a defining characteristic of what would later become termed “action painting.”"

Working for the National Child Labor Committee, Hine used photography as a means to an end, photographing children at work, from lone newsboys to factories full of young laborers. The resulting images were the visual spark to debates about reforming child labor laws. In this, his most famous photograph, a small girl stands before a cotton loom that seems to stretch the length of the room, dwarfing her in scale.",

Traditionally, the lily is a symbol of the angel Gabriel, and Mary’s downcast eyes and humble stance imply that she has received his divine message. Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his work synthesizes elements of several European art movements. The choice of a religious subject, the unusual composition, and his interest in the effects of sunlight and shadow reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, the Symbolists, and the Impressionists on Hitchcock’s work.",

Of the 36 paintings he showed at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in the spring of 1882, 27 were figural. Woman and Child at the Well is one of a series of works depicting peasant girls taking a break from their chores, their poses and gestures suggesting narratives that remain ambiguous. As the model for the boy in this composition, Pissarro used his fourth son, Ludovic-Rodolphe, who was four years old at the time.",

Greece and Italy are peninsulas projecting into seas brimming with marine life. A primary source of protein, seafood was a basic staple of the ancient Mediterranean diet; it remains so today. \nKeen observers of their subjects, ancient vase painters so accurately captured the shapes and markings of the fish they depicted that it is possible to identify most of them by species. This example is decorated with two pairs of large fish. A scallop attached to an outer band of a decorative pattern in the center separates a gilt head, on the left, from a fish known as king of the mullets, on the right. Opposite them is a lettered perch confronting a scorpion fish. Details of their anatomy were drawn with dilute glaze. Around them are shells, a small fish, and other creatures. A running wave pattern around the central concavity, with a gently sloped floor for collecting juices or serving sauces, recalls the sea, the source of the bounty.",

In flowing robes, a god and goddess capture a Giant, depicted with wings and serpent-like features, to deliver the final blow in this epic battle. These three animated figures were probably once part of a series of ornamental covers called antefixes, which were placed along the lowest row of roof tiles on a small building, probably a temple. Etruscans often decorated their buildings with brightly colored sculptural compositions based on Greek mythology."

Searching for a new artistic vocabulary, they moved away from the fragmented forms of prewar Cubism and looked to the classical tradition, forging what was known as the “return to order.” This new style had many sources of inspiration, including the art of ancient Greece and Rome, the Renaissance, and even later Neoclassical revivals. Giorgio de Chirico was likewise attracted to the idea of classicism; his The Eventuality of Destiny is in part the result of his study of the works and techniques of the Old Masters.",

Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions. \nThe most famous image from the set is the \"Great Wave\" (Kanagawa oki nami ura), in which a diminutive Mount Fuji can be seen in the distance under the crest of a giant wave.

Stylistically, it is characterized by a horizontal format; tight, invisible brushwork; and pervasive light emanating from an unseen source.

In the early 1930s, Arp began to translate his abstract style into three-dimensional sculptures, emphasizing the natural processes of metamorphosis in art. The artist often realized his sculptures first in plaster, a medium that responded easily to touch and allowed for the element of chance in the creative process, and later in an edition in different media (often bronze). This sculpture is a unique marble enlargement of Arp’s original plaster. The medium—with its hard, bonelike appearance—emphasizes the human, torsolike forms of Growth.",

    "tale" : "The prosperous Goryeo dynasty that gave its name to modern-day Korea produced some of the world’s most esteemed ceramics. Preeminent among these are celadons, whose iron-rich glazes had been refined by Chinese potters to create a subtle range of gray and bluish-green hues. Under the Goryeo court, Korean craftsmen drew upon the Chinese celadon tradition to create wares of unprecedented beauty and ingenuity. The technical refinement and stylistic naiveté of this intricately constructed bird-shaped ewer exemplify a distinctively Korean aesthetic. Whereas the creature’s plump body resembles a duck’s, its head is crowned with a cockscomb. Disproportionately small wings project out as if in flight, while the tail swoops upward to form a reticulated handle that supports a man who stands atop the bird’s back, holding a bowl. His elaborate headdress and long, flowing robe suggest that he represents an immortal. Details of his garments, as well as of the bird’s overlapping scales and layered feathers, were finely carved and incised into the clay body before glazing and firing; areas where the glaze naturally pooled appear a slightly deeper green. As a final touch, dots of underglaze iron brown accent the eyes. Although wine or other liquids could be poured into the figure’s bowl and out through the bird’s smiling beak, this vessel may have been designed purely as an ingeniously whimsical work of art.",

In Desert Forms, there is no hint as to the nature of the relationship between the walking woman and the distant man. The artist linked the starkness of his imagery to his experience as an African American man, later recalling, “Unconsciously it has a lot to do with a sense of alienation … and in all blacks there is an awareness of their isolation from the mainstream of society.” But the uncertainty presented by Desert Forms can also be interpreted more broadly as symptomatic of the modern human condition. The figures are anonymous and disconnected from each other, facing an austere and insecure world. Lee-Smith thus made a powerful statement about the loneliness that can be experienced by any human, black or white.",

He meandered with his camera through the jazz bars, cafés, and restaurants of Saint–Germain–des–Prés, producing a series of photographs that captured the rebellious youth culture of that time, later published as the book Love on the Left Bank. Shot in quick succession, these two street views show police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators and employ an aerial perspective that contrasts starkly with the casual intimacy found in most of Elsken’s images. Yet they reflect a parallel concern with the state of postwar French society, which he indicted as “bourgeois, individualistic, decadent, rotten and deadly … with nothing to offer its young people.”",

Lysimachus (reigned 323–281 BCE), one of Alexander’s companions and bodyguards, used the king’s image on his own coins in order to cast himself in the role of successor and legitimize his claim to the kingdom of Thrace. Alexander, responsible for establishing the conventions of royal portraiture, is depicted in his preferred manner: youthful and clean-shaven, with long locks of hair rising above his forehead and eyes cast upward. Additionally, he is shown with horns curling around his ears. These “horns of Ammon” symbolize Alexander’s claim that he was the son of the Egyptian god Ammon—a claim reportedly confirmed by the oracle at the sanctuary of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa, Egypt. \nOn the reverse of the coin, Lysimachus exerts his own royal autonomy by naming himself “king.” The goddesses Athena and Nike (Greek for “victory”) crown his name with laurels, which symbolized victory or honor. The lion on the shield at Athena’s side references Lysimachus’s famous exploit of killing a lion with his bare hands and reinforces his association with Alexander, who used the skin of the Nemean lion as a symbol of power and courage.",

She also diligently applied herself to needlework, meticulously working all of her quilts by hand, even after setbacks: she suffered significant hearing loss and had to discontinue practicing medicine in 1919, and she faced difficulties with her vision in later years.—Making Memories: Quilts as Souvenirs, October 20, 2017-April 1, 2018",

The tight curves on the brow suggest the figure is concentrating, while the tension between the nose and mouth, which pull in opposite directions, conveys anxiety. In contrast to the cheerful pink cheeks, the figure’s tear-shaped eyes communicate distress. The thinly painted, ghostly outline of the head and shoulders is in contrast to the crisp rendering of the face. Klee paints the heart, the true creative center, black, thereby suggesting the pall that settled over this figure, and by extension, the artist at this time.",

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he turned his attention away from painting, instead focusing on sculpture, printmaking, and drawing. In 1975, at the age of 71, de Kooning began one of the most productive periods of painting in his career, quickly completing 20 new, large canvases within 6 months. Untitled XI belongs to this series, which was, with a few exceptions, untitled and chronologically numbered. Moving away from tightly organized compositions, de Kooning used free-flowing brushwork and softened, sensuous hues to liberate form. Here the figurative references that are dominant in his earlier work are nearly lost within a far more lyrical and joyful abstract landscape.",

Monet would later follow Boudin’s practice of painting in the open air, the technique that gave this image of a beach for middle-class vacationers its vivid spontaneity and atmospheric light. This practice would be particularly important for Monet and his contemporaries, who came to be known as the Impressionists. \nEugène-Louis Boudin painted many beach scenes at the fashionable tourist spots of Trouville and Deauville in Normandy. In them we see the life of the Paris boulevards translated to the seashore. Bathing attire being still relatively rare, people wore the same clothes at the beach as they did in the city and made the same round of promenades, visits, and dinners. The huts on wheels are portable changing machines that were pulled into the water so that bathers could change without fear of exposure.",

    "tale" : "In 1911 the department store was a relatively new and important urban institution, and The Shoe Shop depicts the activities of female employees and their customers. Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones rendered this modern subject in a rapid, painterly style, paying particular attention to effects of light and atmosphere. Her early work often represented women in the modern city: nursemaids at home, women strolling in the park, shoppers, and store clerks. Strongly influenced by artist William Merritt Chase, Sparhawk-Jones’s painting constitutes a highly personal vision that drew from both Realism and Impressionism.",

Hartley particularly favored this model, a French-Canadian light heavyweight boxer. He explained, “I have for the first time since 1922 a real live model a magnificent young feller… . His body is so fine and dear I could work almost without end from him.” Hartley delighted in the boxer’s strong physique, exaggerating his anatomy and painting the background a deep red to heighten the impression of his vitality. Hartley’s figure paintings enjoyed great success. Critics in the early 1940s praised them for their depictionof strong masculinity, willfully ignoring their controversial homoerotic undertones.",

President Thomas Jefferson refused to continue to pay tribute or ransom to Tripoli to prevent the pirating of American merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. Jefferson dispatched the American ship Enterprise to the Tripolitan waters as a sign of resistance just as Tripoli increased its tribute demands and declared war against the United States. Thomas Birch, an early specialist in maritime painting, captured the battle between the Enterprise and a Tripolitan cruiser in the Mediterranean’s dark, violent waters. The break in the clouds sheds light on this conflict and illuminates Birch’s fine details and precise rendering of these ships.",

Andre invites viewers to walk upon his sculptures so that they can register, on a sensory level, the feel of different materials (such as steel and aluminum) and the distinction between standing in the middle of a sculpture and remaining outside of its boundaries. Originally exhibited as part of a single installation entitled 37 Pieces of Work, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1970, Steel-Aluminum Plain alternates identically sized steel and aluminum plates that form a six-square-foot checkerboard pattern of subdued visual restraint.",

In Leda, sculptural metamorphosis became the very subject of the work. According to classical mythology, the god Zeus changed into a swan in order to seduce the beautiful Leda. Brancusi explained to visitors to his studio that he chose to transform the transformation—changing Leda, rather than Zeus, into a swan. He explained, \"I never could imagine a male being turned into a swan, impossible, but a woman, yes, quite easily.\" Brancusi envisioned the form \"ceaselessly creating a new life, a new rhythm,\" which he enhanced by its circular concrete base, a type that he designed by 1916 and used in various sizes for many different sculptures.",

After it was purchased by an American patron, Rosenthal’s work sparked Elaine hysteria: clubs were formed in her honor, dirges and waltzes were composed, and copies of Idylls of the King sold out in bookstores.",

    "tale" : "Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) is considered one of the greatest artists in Japanese history, and one of the important masters of the Japanese woodblock print. Hokusai’s most famous work is the series Fugaku sanju-rokkei (Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji), created between 1830 and 1832, when the artist was over seventy years of age. This brilliant series actually consists of forty-six views of the well-known mountain: the extra ten scenes were added by Hokusai to the initial thirty-six views. The ingenuity of artistic expression and the astonishing variety of vantage points from which Mount Fuji is viewed are a testament to Hokusai’s creativity.Mount Fuji, known as \"Fuji-san,\" is the highest mountain in Japan, with a height of 12,385 feet. Once an active volcano, its last great eruption was in 1707. Well before Hokusai’s time, Mount Fuji had been worshipped as a sacred mountain, and in his day it was a destination for pilgrims from all over Japan.While known for his novel and dynamic compositions, Hokusai’s greatest strength was undoubtedly his remarkable draftsmanship. As a colorist, he was capable of being both bold and sensitive, and much of his success depended on his judicious combination of both exceptional drawing and dazzling color. Here, the mountain is shown with clear skies at its summit and a thunderstorm near its base. The combination of the elegant sloping sides of the volcano and the sharp, jagged lines of lightning at the bottom results in an image of great simplicity and visual force.",

    "tale" : "Writing in 1913 to his friend the American art historian Walter Pach, Raymond Duchamp-Villon declared, \"The power of the machine imposes itself upon us and we can scarcely conceive living bodies without it.\" That year the French sculptor began his preliminary sketches and clay studies for Horse, progressively abstracting these initial naturalistic renderings of the animal’s anatomy into a coiled configuration of geometric forms suggestive of pistons, gears, and shafts. Optimistically embracing the clean aesthetic and dynamic potential of the machine, Duchamp-Villon reinterpreted the traditional subject of equestrian sculpture for the modern era. The artist completed only a small plaster of the final version of Horse; he died before he could realize his plans to enlarge and cast it in bronze. This was done by his brothers, Jacques Villon and Marcel Duchamp, in 1930–31.",

The border of the tapestry displays an array of allegorical, biblical, and mythological scenes and figures.

The figure sits astride his horse at an elevated position, his head and torso above the horizon, outlined by the pale blue sky behind him. Portraying the man with a direct gaze and his hand on the reins, Remington suggested that the vaquero was a fixture of the local terrain. The artist created a version of A Mexican Vaquero as a wood engraving, which appeared in Harper’s Monthly in 1891.",

Having trained in Philadelphia and Paris, Cassatt ventured alone to Spain to study the country’s masters and to follow the artistic path of modern painters like Édouard Manet. Depicting the bullfighter at a relaxed moment, far removed from the spectacle and violence of the ring, Cassatt elided narrative detail. Instead, with a modernist sensibility, she focused on the male figure in a casual pose and employed vigorous brushwork and rich pigment to describe his costume. The bullfighter’s characteristic bravado nevertheless hints at flirtation with a female counterpart outside the frame.",

    "tale" : "During 1884 and 1885, Georges Seurat was hard at work on the most ambitious painting of his career, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884, now a centerpiece of the Art Institute’s collection of 19th-century French painting. The artist’s genesis of this large canvas involved many preparatory studies, which fall primarily into two groups: small compositional sketches and color studies on wooden panels, and nuanced Conté crayon drawings that explore both the empty landscape and the shapes of specific figures or figural groups. In this contemplative drawing, Seurat developed the expressive contours of the seated female figure holding a parasol that would ultimately occupy the center of the finished painting.",

    "tale" : "Japanese aristocrats engaged in the elegant custom of recollecting classical poetry while viewing spring and autumn foliage. In these delicate screens, premier court painter Tosa Mitsuoki meditated on the inevitable passage of beauty by depicting the melancholy hours after the departure of reveling courtiers. A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen, while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called tanzaku, waft from the blossoming limbs, the remaining evidence of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early-medieval aristocratic life.",

    "tale" : "This painting exemplifies Yves Tanguy’s late style, especially as he practiced it after his move to the United States in 1939, where he married the American painter  Kay Sage. The forms have become harder and more sculptural, resembling strangely shaped stones, rather than the amorphous creatures of his earlier paintings, and echoing more clearly the prehistoric stones—the dolmens and menhirs—of Tanguy’s native Brittany. Color is also intensified, as the artist makes more generous use of the orange-red and blue found only spottily in earlier works, such as his 1928 screen. The arrangement, size, and shape of these forms has become more varied, from the regimented clustering of forms on the right to the horizontal scattering of forms on the left and in the background. The viewer is also brought visually closer to the scene through the cropping of forms in the foreground.The title of the painting (inscribed on the back as La Rapidite des sommeils) works in conjunction with the image to heighten its enigma and mystery, as in the works of  Giorgio de Chirico and  Rene Magritte. Perhaps the title refers to the onset of sleep, or to the different stages of sleep, as the French use of the plural \"sommeils\" seems to suggest. This interpretation seems to find a visual equivalent in the progression from congested, active foreground to sparse, quiet back-ground, from the thicket of vertical forms on the right to the more relaxed rhythm of horizontal forms extending into the distance. In the middle ground, at left, is an unusual configuration that seems particularly evocative in relation to the title. A horizontal form reminiscent of a sleeping figure lies, as in a bed or coffin, within the rectangular space defined by a rocklike border. Is Tanguy referring to the sleep that ushers in the dream-world of his landscapes or to the ultimate sleep, the sleep of death? The mood of the picture hovers uncertainly between the ominous and the contemplative, between lower and upper halves, engendering a desire to traverse the inhospitable foreground to reach the soothing, misty reaches of the background. Given the date of the work, at the end of World War II, one also wonders whether there is embedded in this work something of the emotional tenor of the times, a yearning for a peace that would transcend recent history.—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 176-177.",

The particularly fine decoration of etched floral arabesques suggests the workmanship of the Augsburg armory, perhaps of Jörg T. Sorg. The elements of this armor are from the same garniture—multiple matching pieces of armor that could convert a basic suit into various field or sporting armors. Perforations on the breastplate are for bolting a shock-absorbing lance rest in place and reinforcing plate armor for sporting events. When approaching an opponent, the latch door on the helmet would be closed for protection, whereas in more casual times, the door would be opened for air circulation.",

The faces, makeup, and hairstyles of Currin’s women, however, are always borrowed from contemporary magazines and advertisements. Ultimately, the artist’s fusion of high and low source materials produces distinctly beautiful, often disturbing, works that are equal parts homage and parody. This painting is a direct quotation of Annibale Carracci’s Dead Christ (c. 1584; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart)."

The political and personal hardships Milton endured appealed to Fuseli and to the Romantic temper of his time. Here, in one of three paintings showing Milton’s life rather than his poetry, the blind poet, inspired by an inner light, dictates his epic poem Paradise Lost to one of his daughters."

In 1941 Wood wrote about Curry: “It was action he loved most to interpret: the lunge through space, the split second before the kill, the suspended moment before the storm strikes.” Hogs Killing a Snake reveals his fascination with the violence of nature and the struggle for survival. Curry deliberately constructed the dynamic composition to heighten the vitality of his subject; the hogs converge from all angles upon the writhing snake, giving a sense of violent motion. Curry accentuated the vigor of the composition with his painting technique, using short, choppy brushstrokes and even scratching on the surface of the paint to suggest the bristling hair on the hogs’ backs. Although the subject was ostensibly drawn from a childhood experience, the painting transcends mere realism to become nearly epic.",

    "tale" : "Starting in 96 with the reign of Emperor Nerva, Rome was ruled by five wise leaders who came to be known as the “Good Emperors.” Nerva (reigned 96–98) was an honest and respected senator who enacted compassionate social programs. His rule ushered in a period of peace and prosperity, which is suggested by the sheer abundance of coins produced during this era as well as by the skill and artistry of the images created. Coins of this period, especially gold aurei like this one, were often perfectly round, well struck, and centered. \nAntoninus Pius (reigned 138–61), continued the wise and caring example of Nerva which is reflected in his nickname, Pius, meaning “pious.” Able to maintain peace through the strength of the Army, Rome was strong and prosperous under Antoninus’s firm rule.",

The smooth, rounded forms of the red and pink rocks appear in enigmatic relation to one another, as the red pebble appears to recede from the picture plane even though it must be perched on top of the pink stone. Their abstracted forms and warm colors contrast sharply with the bleached, angular teeth and hard, cracked appearance of the jawbone and together construct a modern trompe l’oeil that questions the nature of representation and perception.",

In this relatively early and rather damaged portrait, he followed 15th-century tradition by employing an immobile pose, barely allowing his subject’s hands to appear above the sill of the picture frame. Yet Massys developed a distinctive and nuanced manner of modeling the face, which here conveys a strong sense of individual character. The pink, or carnation, held by the sitter could refer to matrimony or to Christ’s incarnation.",

The artist painted this work directly, and the immediacy of his process is visible in the loose brushstrokes in the lower right portion of the canvas that shift in color. The spontaneity of this approach relates to monotypes that Matisse was working on at the same time, one-of-a-kind prints made by drawing directly onto an already inked plate, which allowed no room for revision.",

Shukongo-jin belongs to the same category of gods as the paired guardians (nio) often placed on either side of the gateways to Buddhist temples. \nBecause Shukongo-jin was not intended to blend into a sculptural ensemble, artists frequently used the opportunity to portray him as an occasion for eccentric and exaggerated effects. This figure, for example, is comparatively small, but it still conveys the threat of explosive force appropriate to the deity’s role. He stands surrounded by churning waves, while a divine wind blows his garments about and fuels the flames that are his hair. The hyperrealism of his chiseled muscles and bulging veins is a characteristic feature of Japanese sculpture of this era.",

    "tale" : "Shirin Neshat’s work addresses the social, political, and psychological dimensions of women’s experience in contemporary Islamic societies. Because Rapture was made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and the renewed tensions between the United States and the Middle East, current viewers’ reactions are informed by associations about Islam and Iran that would likely not have affected perceptions of the work at the time of its 1999 debut in a focus exhibition at the Art Institute. Rapture is a meditation on the gender politics of Islam. These relationships, embodied by the image of the veiled woman, are often subjected to reductive caricature in the West. Although Neshat actively resists stereotypical representations of Islam, her artistic objectives have not been explicitly polemical. Rather, her work recognizes the complex intellectual and religious forces shaping the identity of Muslim women throughout the world. \nRapture is an installation of two synchronized black-and-white video sequences that are projected on opposite walls; large in scale, they evoke cinema screens. Working with hours of footage and a team of editors, the artist constructed two parallel narratives: on one side of the room, men populate an architectural environment; in the other sequence, women move within a natural one. The piece begins with images of a stone fortress and a hostile desert, respectively. The fortress dissolves into a shot of over one hundred men—uniformly dressed in plain white shirts and black pants—walking quickly through the cobblestone streets of an old city and entering the gates of the fortress. Simultaneously, the desert scene dissolves into a shot of an apparently equal number of women, wearing flowing, full-length veils, or chadors, emerging from different points in the barren landscape. \nAs the video progresses, the men busy themselves with a variety of mundane, sometimes absurd activities that contradict the intended function of the space. On the other side of the installation, the women chant, pray, and later, having made their way across the desert, launch a boat into the sea with six of their own aboard. In Rapture, Neshat self-consciously exploits entrenched clichés about gender and space: namely, the equation of woman with irrational, wild nature and man with rational, ordered culture. The video installation is itself a study of gendered group dynamics, with the viewer literally positioned between two opposing worlds. The players in Neshat’s surreal, segregated narratives are deployed in a syncopated rhythm of action and nonaction, mutual recognition and nonrecognition, advance and retreat. \nRapture exists as a poignant reflection on the rootless, unsettled psychology of exile. As an Iranian expatriate living in the United States, Neshat maintains a critical distance that has allowed her to locate both the poetics and the power of the veil. At the same time she celebrates the strength and beauty of Islamic women, she remains keenly aware of the horrors of repression.",

The further the saint waded, the heavier his burden became, until, safe on the opposite bank, he realized that he had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, as well as its creator. Israhel van Meckenem made several prints of this subject showing the saint in varying degrees of strain, struggling under the weight and in the swift torrent. This print is unusual in that it shows the saint’s feet through the transparent water; the shallow depth confirms that Christopher has just reached the opposite bank.",

He invited friends to produce small pieces that could be smuggled into the exhibition in his cabinet-shaped construction. A painting by his former wife, artist Susan Weil, appears behind the right door, and a flag composition by Jasper Johns once sat behind the left door. (It went missing in 1965 and was replaced at Rauschenberg’s invitation with a facsimile by the artist Sturtevant.) The work also includes a Judy Garland autograph, an image of Abraham Lincoln, and a postcard of grazing cows, among other items. While Short Circuit captures aspects of a collective American experience, it also ranks among the most personal of Rauschenberg’s combines.",

In this panoramic landscape, she captured the massive appearance of the mountains as they rise sharply from the water’s edge. Although she enjoyed her trip to Canada, and returned again that year, ultimately O’Keeffe preferred the New Mexican landscape, specifically its brilliant sunshine.",

    "tale" : "Paul Strand spent the summer of 1916 at his family’s cottage in Twin Lakes, Connecticut, attempting to give his understanding of Cubist art—abstraction through fragmentation, multiple points of view, and a reduction of people and objects to basic geometry—a photographic form. Strand made several radical choices in this work: he abandoned the traditional, upright perspective of the photograph; caused the table to appear tipped, as if to suspend its utilitarian function; deployed shadows to create powerful compositional diagonals; and suggested objectivity in the crispness of his negative and print. When Porch Shadows appeared in the final issue of Camera Work, it was a clear signal of a new aesthetic. As Strand wrote, true modernists should avoid all “tricks of process or manipulation” to celebrate photography’s inherent qualities as art.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",

    "tale" : "For over thirty years, Bill Viola has created single-channel videos as well as sound and video installations that focus on spirituality and explore multiple levels of human consciousness. In constructing these works, the artist draws from his extensive study of Eastern and Western art, philosophy, and religion. He also consistently deploys cutting-edge technologies, investigating new ways to manipulate viewers’ percep-tion. Both the videos in The Reflecting Pool and the installation Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House are important early works that foreshadow Viola’s later creations, combining philosophic inquiry with captivating physical environments.The Reflecting Pool is a series comprising five individual videos, including Moonblood, that offer a collective meditation on the various stages in an individual life. The first work, also titled The Reflecting Pool, demonstrates the shift from stillness to motion as a fixed camera captures a man approaching a pool of water through trees and lush foliage. The only sounds are those of the branches rustling and the water rippling. The man momentarily stands before the pool before jumping into the air. As he reaches the crest of his jump, he is frozen in space while the water beneath him continues to undulate. There is a fleeting reflection of other people walking around the pool, although no one can be seen doing so. After a series of similar perceptual and temporal fragmentations, the man’s image fades, leaving only the pool. The final moments of the video are evocative of baptism, as a nude man emerges from the water and retreats into the woods.In this series, Viola aims to deconstruct viewers’ concepts of time and memory, divorcing images from their subjective meaning and reconnecting them to universal truths. This process of fostering self-awareness is an undercurrent of the artist’s practice. He has remarked, “There’s another dimension that you just know is there, that can be a source of real knowledge, and the quest for connecting with that and identifying that is the whole impetus for me to cultivate these experiences and to make my work.”In both The Reflecting Pool and Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, the artist urges viewers to become active participants. Of his work, Viola stated, “You’re a part of it. It’s not something that’s just a fixed projection from the past.”",

This area was occupied by distinctive cultures that coexisted with the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties. Along this southern frontier, it appears that large bronze bells were more important than bronze vessels to the local aristocracy. \nThis bell was designed to be mounted on its hollow stem with its curved mouth facing up and struck from the outside with a mallet. Unlike other types of bronze bells that were assembled as chime sets, this one was intended to be played as an individual instrument. It may have been sounded during ceremonies or military campaigns. The eyebrow-shaped lines that skim the margins of this bell depict imaginary dragons or realistic reptiles.",

    "tale" : "By age 30, Édouard Manet had gained recognition at the state-sponsored Salon exhibition in Paris and established himself as the artist to watch, creating new imagery for contemporary works that translated Old Master painting into a modern idiom. Here he looked to the 17th-century Baroque artist Diego Velázquez, whose two paintings of world-weary philosophers (Aesop and Menippus, both c. 1638) Manet had admired that year at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. Like Velázquez’s representation of the ancient stoics (whose poverty is associated with wisdom), Manet’s beggar-philosophers fit into the popular notion of the social outcast as a seer possessing rare insight. \nThis painting and Beggar with a Duffle Coat were probably conceived as companion pieces.",

    "tale" : "An old woman riding a goat and brandishing a broomstick dominates this picture, which is an outstanding example of Cornelis Saftleven’s work in a traditional Netherlandish genre: scenes of hellfire and witchcraft. Pioneered by Hieronymous Bosch and given new life by Jan Brueghel and Jacques de Gheyn II a century later, such ghoulish subjects were aimed at an audience of sophisticated collectors. Paintings and drawings in this genre combine precise scientific observation—as here in the moth wings of the howling figure on the right—with a sense of powerful, uncontrolled natural forces.",

    "tale" : "This diptych, a hinged and portable work used for private devotion, was probably made in the Latin Kingdom established in the Holy Land by the Crusaders. In style, technique, and the use of both Latin and Greek inscriptions, it shows a mixture of Eastern and Western elements. The diptych may have been made by an Italian craftsman, possibly working in the coastal city of Acre, which was the capital of a reduced crusader kingdom in the late 13th century. This type of private devotional work, and related Byzantine models imported back into Western Europe, exerted a powerful influence on later painting in Italy, France, and the Low Countries.",

The armor was expertly crafted for protection: the smooth, rounded shape, breastplate with a pronounced vertical ridge down the center, and heavy roping (turned edge etched with lines) at the upper edge of the breastplate functioned to deflect sword thrusts and glancing blows. Thick roping on the gauntlet knuckles acted as added protection. The helmet, with its smooth, rounded form, was shaped to deflect downward blows away from the head. The bracket attached to the right breastplate is called the lance rest, a shock-absorbing support designed to hold the lance when it was couched under the right armpit.",

Some tombs had as many as one ushabti for every day of the year and another 36 overseers to keep order. All but the poorest citizens provided themselves with some kind of funerary furnishings.

In Winged Figure, Thayer mixed this idealism with a level of naturalism, particularizing the woman’s features and giving her form a sense of mass and gravity.",

    "tale" : "With its monumental proportions, white volute handles, and red-figure decoration, this amphora bears a striking resemblance to vases from Apulia on the eastern coast of southern Italy. However, this vase belongs to the Faliscan culture, the Etruscans’ southernmost neighbor in the region of modern-day Tuscany. Together, the Etruscans and Faliscans would struggle against Roman expansion. The high quality and popularity of the Faliscan wares vied with Roman ceramic production, intensifying the tension between the regions. Here a nude female hands a young warrior his armor, and around the neck are sea-creatures.",

Informed by her earlier profession as a graphic designer, her work typically combines iconography appropriated from 1940s and 1950s American film, television, and advertising with blunt slogans ripe with subtle insinuations. Kruger explained, “I’m interested in how identities are constructed, how stereotypes are formed, how narratives sort of congeal and become history.” By using the pronouns we and you and removing the identifying features of the figure, Kruger implicated the viewer, regardless of gender, in the objectification of this anonymous woman.",

Nanteuil frequently brought friends to entertain his models as they sat, giving his portraits a relaxed, natural look, but Louis XIV was a reputedly difficult subject who detested sitting for extended periods. Nonetheless, Nanteuil would engrave 12 portraits of the king, and draw him in person on more than one occasion. As his career progressed, Nanteuil’s prints grew more painterly in quality, with subtler chiaroscuro effects, evident here in the carefully hatched shadows behind Louis XIV.",

Speaking of the Petit Trianon, whose private rooms inspired this salon, Mrs. Thorne wrote, “Nothing could be more chaste, more restrained. This was Marie Antoinatte’s favorite retreat and it is here that I always feel her shadow.”",

Although it was immediately acclaimed for its modern architecture, only two years later the building was dismantled and reassembled in Sydenham. (It was destroyed by fire in 1936.) In this small oil painting, Pissarro relegated what was considered the world’s largest building to the left side of the canvas, as if to give equal space to the “modern-life” scene of families and carriages parading by Sydenham’s more recently constructed middle-class homes.",

It combines the Impressionists’ gestural brushwork with a heightened chiaroscuro (light and shade) drawn from Spanish Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez. These compositions helped to establish Sargent’s reputation in Paris as a daring and original painter.",

    "tale" : "Through his studies of groups of bathers outdoors, Paul Cézanne reconceived a classical subject in a modern, pictorial idiom. Though clearly related, The Bathers is not a study for either of the monumental canvases of bather subjects that the artist left unfinished at his death; rather, it is an independent, exploratory work painted with a more spritely touch. For all its compositional complexity, it retains the lightness of a watercolor, with thin parallel strokes and dashes and areas of white-primed canvas showing through the paint.",

The Norman town of Étretat was famous for its cliffs, rock formations, and fashionable summer homes, but Boats on the Beach at Étretat shows none of these familiar sights. Forced indoors by inclement weather, Monet painted this narrow view of the beach from his room in the Hôtel Blanquet, where he stayed from mid-October to mid-December 1885. In a letter to his future wife, he noted that he had spent the afternoon “painting the caloges [disused fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain.”",

    "tale" : "Of the foremost realists of the 1930s, Reginald Marsh was fascinated by public behavior and the exciting commotion of New York. Tattoo and Haircut portrays a busy scene of people below the massive structure of the El on the Bowery, then an area notorious as a skid row. Rendered in Marsh’s gently satirical style are several city types: a derelict on crutches, loitering men conversing or smoking cigarettes, a chic woman walking by herself. Marsh used an egg tempera medium to fill every inch of the composition with details, from architectural elements to signs and text. Introduced to the artist by the muralist Thomas Hart Benton, the medium suited Marsh’s keen skills as a draftsman. Here he added successive films of tempera in muted colors, using its mottled, uneven surface to emphasize the grimy nature of this world. His technique thus reinforces his presentation of the subject: cacophonous, dilapidated, and dim, yet vibrantly alive."

Among his finest narrative works are these six panels, part of a series of twelve depicting the life of Saint John the Baptist, the kinsman and prophet of Christ. Other panels from the series are scattered in European and American collections; they may originally have formed the doors of a shrine housing a relic of the saint. In the first of the Art Institute’s panels, the young Baptist enters the wilderness to live as a hermit; later he foretells Christ’s role as redeemer, is imprisoned, and is finally martyred at the request of Salome, the step-daughter of King Herod.",

    "tale" : "During the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, some of the finest armorers worked exclusively for royal patrons in the workshops set up to meet their needs. In 1511 King Henry VIII of England established such a workshop at Greenwich Palace outside London, which produced outstanding armor for the English court for over a century. It was staffed largely by German craftsmen, among them Jacob Halder, who was master workman at Greenwich when this half-armor was produced around 1588–90. Made for a high-ranking nobleman, it features crisply decorated bands of etching and gilding and a silhouette mimicking fashionable dress. The shape of the breastplate, broad at the shoulders, narrow at the waist, and dipped at the belly, imitates the peasecod (peapod-shaped) cut of a gentleman’s doublet of the same period. Despite the lavish decoration and exaggerated shape, this armor, intended for the field of battle, was capable of withstanding musket fire. Indeed, it was commissioned in 1588, at the very moment England was preparing for invasion by the Spanish Armada. But to the fashionable noble who commissioned this harness, demonstrating wealth and status was as important as protecting life and limb.",

The Vétheuil series shows the view across the river from Monet’s balcony at various times of day. This painting depicts midday, and the one at right represents sunset. As he did for numerous works, beginning with the canvases for the series Mornings on the Seine, he used a nearly square canvas, so that the decorative effect takes precedence over the details of the scene itself.",

By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence. By a remarkable coincidence, at the turn of the 20th century, these two closely related works found their way by very different means to the Art Institute’s collection.",

She soon made a name for herself with large-format, often allegorical compositions and portraits that defied the conventions of Victorian photography. A typical commercial portrait of the time presented a small standing figure, sharply focused and evenly lit. By contrast, Cameron’s photograph of her niece Julia Jackson concentrates on the subject’s head, showing clearly only limited planes of her face and leaving half of it shrouded in shadow. Known as a great beauty, Jackson was a favorite subject for Cameron, who made dozens of photographs of her. In April 1867, a month before Jackson’s wedding to her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, Cameron photographed the young bride-to-be. With her hair down and eyes wide, she is unsentimental, looking forward with purpose to her own personal and social transformation.",

    "tale" : "Following its introduction from India centuries earlier, Buddhism flourished in China under the powerfully cosmopolitan Tang dynasty. Characteristic of Tang style in its robust, tapered physique, this monumental figure exhibits iconographic features distinctive to the Buddha: tightly curled hair covering a cranial mound symbolizes his enlightenment; and a forehead depression that originally held a stone or jewel represents wisdom. The articulated folds of the deity’s flowing robe integrate Indian sensuality with a distinctly Tang blend of realism and linear elegance. Capping the deity’s right shoulder, this garment discreetly modifies a fully bare-chested style described in Indian monastic texts. \nThe stepped pedestal rises from a base encircled by lotus petals pure white flowers that rise from muddy water and thereby evoke Buddhist beliefs in purity and the search for enlightenment. Above, musicians encircling the tapered stem evoke an ideal, celestial realm. \nTogether with two attendant bodhisattvas in the Art Institute collection (1930.84 and 1930.85), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site. The scale and stone medium of these figures suggest that they were commissioned for a cave temple or shrine—a chamber carved into the face of a mountain or cliff.",

Further reducing and abbreviating form, Brancusi revised some works by casting them in metal with a fine finish.

    "tale" : "Rising to prominence in the 1990s, Takashi Murakami skillfully mixes Japanese pop culture, animé, and cartoon aesthetics into a new form of global pop art. At once an artist and a businessman, his large-scale paintings and sculptures are as well known as his mass-produced trinkets and collaborations with Louis Vuitton. However, both practices disclose his persistent and tempered engagement with art-historical precedents set by Pop Art. In 2000 Murakami coined the term “superflat” to describe not only his art practice and that of his Japanese contemporaries but also a larger cultural shift toward the “extremely two-dimensional.” While this sensibility is most present in Japanese animé, Murakami asserts it is a worldwide phenomenon. According to Murakami’s own “Superflat Manifesto,” the phrase accounts for the way in which different layers of culture, especially high and low, “fuse into one.” Mr. Pointy embodies the concept of superflat. The character combines religious iconography taken from sources as diverse as Mayan culture, Tibetan Buddhism, and the Thousand-Armed Buddha (Kannon in Japanese) with a cartoon style. Mr. Pointy was devised by Murakami in 2003 and has since been repeatedly rendered in paintings, mass-market prints, and sculptures.",

He also revisited an Impressionist subject that his colleagues had all but abandoned by the 1890s—the modern city. This bustling scene, alive with the noise and movement of traffic and pedestrians, was the view from his window at the Hôtel Garnier in Paris, where he stayed for a few weeks early in 1893. The building at the left edge of the canvas is the Gare Saint-Lazare.",

Among his finest narrative works are these six panels, part of a series of twelve depicting the life of Saint John the Baptist, the kinsman and prophet of Christ. Other panels from the series are scattered in European and American collections; they may originally have formed the doors of a shrine housing a relic of the saint. In the first of the Art Institute’s panels, the young Baptist enters the wilderness to live as a hermit; later he foretells Christ’s role as redeemer, is imprisoned, and is finally martyred at the request of Salome, the step-daughter of King Herod.",

    "tale" : "The Water Fan depicts a young black man intently searching for coral using a glass-bottomed bucket. Referred to as a “water glass” or “sponge glass,” this device was used to stabilize the surface of moving water in order to improve visibility. Homer may have been attracted to the subject because it draws attention to the constantly moving surface of the water as well as its transparency, aspects of the sea that especially intrigued him in the Bahamas. Like The Sponge Diver (1898\/99; MFA Boston), this work originally had more visible red washes in the water, hinting at the pink coral beneath the surface. While these areas have faded, the fluid strokes of darker blue over layers of transparent turquoise are effective in suggesting the play of light, both direct and reflected, over water. \nHomer depicted light shimmering on the ocean using watercolor paper with a heavy twill texture in The Water Fan. The diagonal pattern of the sheet, which runs from top right to lower left, was imparted during manufacture by the papermaker’s woven wire screen that supported the paper pulp during sheet formation. The opposite side is relatively smooth. A truncated watermark reading “J WHAT,” for J Whatman, the manufacturer, reads from the textured side, indicating the side intended for painting.",

    "inscription" : "No markings recto or verso Short Mountain is a two hundred-acre faerie sanctuary\/safe queer space in central Tennessee, fifty miles southeast of Nashville. The tall hill upon which the sanctuary sits is named Short Mountain. About sixteen permanent residents live there, off the grid, with drinking water from a mountain spring and bathhouse water from a cistern. Solar panels produce a limited amount of electricity. The community grows much of its own food, and goats supply milk. The faeries’ deeply sacrosanct and wildly celebratory sense of the earth particularly manifests itself at their May Day gathering, which they refer to as “Beltane” (a tradition of the Druids). The festival can last ten days and draw five hundred guests of all genders and orientations. Short Mountain Sanctuary got its start in 1981 when Milo, the sole remaining member of the Tick Creek Community, announced a need for new members at the Southeast USA Conference of Lesbians and Gay Men. The sanctuary became the first and longest-running Radical Faerie commune in America. A dozen others exist throughout the country, and more can be found in Canada, Europe and Australia. The Radical Faeries were formed in response to what Harry Hay viewed as an increasing tendency toward heteroconformity in the homosexual community. The choice of the word “faerie” reclaims a term used to denigrate gay and transgender men; “radical” infers an emphasis on radical politics. As a non-hierarchical organization, the Radical Faeries have no leader and no set definition of what it means to be one. Of the group, the late Bradley Rose wrote, “There are visions we share and celebrate…a belief in the sacredness of nature and the earth; honoring the interconnectedness of spirit, sex, politics and culture; understanding that each one of us has our own path (paths)...” Since its inception, three new gay-oriented intentional communities have formed nearby—Ida, Sun Valley and Pumpkin Hollow. In the Communities Directory, Short Mountain states its policy: “We are a sanctuary and welcome visitors anytime.” From the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982–2005",

    "title" : "Reclining Nude",
    "tale" : "Though often associated with the German Expressionist movement, Max Beckmann’s artistic production was highly individualistic and eludes strict categorization. While Beckmann had earlier criticized the French avant-garde, by the mid-1920s, he began to identify with artists working in the Parisian art world. He made frequent visits to the city, and his work began to show stylistic affinities with that by artists like Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Rouault. Reclining Nude recalls the long-standing tradition of associating the female body with the timeless ideals of beauty. The stark nature of the model’s pose and distorted form, however, are more modern updates on this classical idea.",

    "tale" : "Over the winter and spring of 1927–28, Bauhaus professor László Moholy-Nagy took a series of perhaps nine views looking down from the Berlin Radio Tower, one of the most exciting new constructions in the German capital. Moholy had already photographed the Eiffel Tower in Paris from below, looking up through the tower’s soaring girders. In Berlin, however, Moholy turned his camera around and pointed it straight down at the ground. This plunging perspective showed off the spectacular narrowness of the Radio Tower, finished in 1926, which rose vertiginously to a height of 450 feet from a base seven times smaller than that of its Parisian predecessor (which opened in 1889). Moholy attached exceptional importance to this, his boldest image: he hung it just above his name in a room devoted to his work at the Berlin showing of Film und Foto, a mammoth traveling exhibition that he had helped to prepare. Moholy also chose this view and one other to offer Julien Levy, the pioneering art dealer, when Levy visited him in Berlin in 1930. The following year the pictures went on view at the Levy Gallery in New York, in Moholy’s first solo exhibition of photographs.",

Bolotowsky believed that this unusual means of presentation created a more spacious composition compared to a square canvas of the same size. Grey Diamond contains many principles of Neo-Plasticism: a lack of depth, the elimination of all representational forms, and carefully balanced color. In embracing the movement, Bolotowsky explained, “Nowadays, when paintings torture the retina, when music gradually destroys the eardrum, there must, all the more, be a need for an art that searches for new ways to achieve harmony and equilibrium.”"

A comparison of Spring with a nearly contemporaneous photograph of the same subject by Stieglitz shows that O’Keeffe simplified the building by omitting the chimney, window, and horizontal siding. She also enlarged the flagpole and curved its top, emphasizing its upward thrust with the vertical format of her picture. Her cropped depiction of the building, with flowering spring trees above, differs considerably from Stieglitz’s broader horizontal view of it in the wintry Adirondack landscape.",

Since he hands his helmet, decorated with a leaping dolphin, to a woman wearing a diadem, or crown, who stands before him, he may be returning from battle. Behind him, another woman extends her hand as if to take his shield, which bears the image of a lion, its tongue extended. \nThis scene is believed to depict Achilles, the great Greek warrior of the Trojan War, at home with his mother, Thetis, her father, and Nereus, and a Nereid, or sea nymph. His helmet pushed back, Achilles is seated before a column, holding a spear in one hand and a libation, or offering, bowl in the other. Before him, Thetis holds an oinochoe, or pitcher, from which she has filled or is about to fill his bowl, while also supporting her son’s shield. Nereus looks on from the right, and a Nereid, a long fillet in her hand, stands behind him. His greaves, or shin protectors, are stored on a shelf in the background.",

    "tale" : "Vasily Kandinsky, along with Franz Marc, Gabriele Münter, and Alexei Jawlensky, were members of the Blue Rider, a loose alliance of artists based in Munich. Although these artists did not have a common style, they did share a belief in the symbolic and spiritual importance of forms and colors and their effect on emotions and memories. The Blue Rider also promoted a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting and looked to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art traditions for inspiration. In this picture, the troika, a horse-drawn sled from Kandinsky’s native Russia, and the hand-painted frame, which he made especially for this work, speak to the powerful impact of these sources on the artist.",

This full-length depiction of two of the daughters of Helena de Kay and Richard Watson Gilder is innovative in its portrayal of spontaneous movement. The Gilders were leaders of an artistic, literary, and musical circle in New York, and they were close friends of Beaux. The girls look down, rather than at the viewer, concentrating on their dance steps. The fluid brushstrokes and use of subtle color accurately convey motion and also give the appearance of a swiftly executed canvas; however, Beaux worked diligently on the picture for over two months.",

    "tale" : "Around 435 BCE, the Greek sculptor Pheidias adorned the front of the shield at the side of his gold-and-ivory statue of Athena in the Parthenon with scenes of Greeks battling Amazons in the Trojan War. In Roman times, certain figures from this complex struggle were lifted out of their original context and enlarged to become decorative reliefs for the walls of a colonnade or courtyard. \nHere a wounded Greek warrior collapses to the ground after being struck a mortal blow from behind. The dying warrior’s noble countenance, the fillet or ribbon tied around his forehead, and his powerful, athletic body epitomize what Pheidias and his pupils sought to project as the ideal of mature male dignity in the decade when Athens was at the height of its power in the eastern Mediterranean world. Some five centuries later, collectors such as the Roman emperor Hadrian sought this Pheidian style, translated from a circular golden shield to a rectangular marble relief, to decorate their palaces and villas. Athenian sculptors of the Roman era made a good living creating and exporting such memories of past glories. This relief and a number of others were found near Athens in the harbor of Piraeus, where they had been lost in a disaster, likely while awaiting shipment.",

    "tale" : "Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire. \nInscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today. \nRoman emperor Nero killed himself in 68, bringing an end to his chaotic reign. What followed was an equally chaotic struggle over who would succeed him. The year 69 saw one general after another rule and die in quick succession: Galba (reigned June 68–Jan. 69), Otho (reigned Jan.–Apr. 69), Vitellius (reigned Apr.–Dec. 69), and finally Vespasian (reigned 69–79), who founded the Flavian dynasty that ruled until 96. The harsh character of these four emperors is emphasized by the realistic features of their coin portraits—the hooked nose of Galba, the double chin and vain curls of Otho (seen in this coin), the plump features of the gluttonous Vitellius, and the lined complexion of battle-hardened Vespasian. \nThe front (obverse) of this coin portrays the head of Emperor Otho to the right, bare. On the back (reverse) is Securitas standing to the left, with a wreath in right hand, scepter in left.",

    "tale" : "George Inness’s rough, energetic brushstrokes evoke the raw beauty and potentially destructive power of the ocean in this dramatic seascape. He created it during a trip to Europe in the early 1870s. It was previously thought to depict Étretat, in Normandy, France, but scholars now believe that the image is of Porto d’Anzio, Italy. The sky is illuminated by patches of orange and white light, outlining the ships and distant town on the horizon. Careful study of the surface of the central rock in the foreground illustrates the artist’s impressive manipulation of paint: by employing shifts in texture and shading, he was able to emphasize distinctions between sun and shadow, wet and dry, and clean and algae-covered. Inness traveled to Europe to study landscape painting with the masters of the Barbizon School, who were known for a personal style that contrasted with the grandiose Hudson River School in America. The influence of this intimate approach is apparent in the painting of the rocks and spraying seawater.",

    "tale" : "During her early Impressionist period, Mary Cassatt frequently captured the activities of middle- and upper-class women in society—at the theater or taking tea, for example. On a Balcony, which was shown in the 1880 Impressionist exhibition, appears to depict a woman in a public setting. However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.",

Their differences point to his growing desire to experiment with his methodology as a watercolor painter. This sketch, possibly made from the Brooklyn Bridge, takes a view of the skyline similar to the other two, yet Marin transformed the small sheet into a kind of floating fantasy. He combined the fluid, improvisational technique of the Weehawken scenes with warm-cool color contrasts, a palette that he soon developed into the iridescent effects seen in his later watercolors.",

    "tale" : "Best known for his Lives of the Artists, a monumental compendium of biographies, Giorgio Vasari was a successful architect and a prolific painter for the Medici dukes of Florence. As a learned artist, he imparted an allegorical element to this frequently depicted episode from the life of Saint Jerome. The saint—a scholar, translator of the Bible, and advocate of monasticism—vividly described the tempting visions that assailed him when he retreated to the desert to meditate. In this painting, Jerome contemplates a crucifix; his visions are personified as Venus, the goddess of love, accompanied by cupids. Although Venus seems to flee, one of the troublesome cupids still aims his arrow at the saint. The work is unfinished: the black-chalk grid, used as aid in enlarging and transferring the preparatory drawing onto the panel, is still visible through the initial thinly applied paint layers.",

    "tale" : "Juan Gris traveled to Paris in 1906 and soon moved to the neighborhood of Montmartre, where he met Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Eventually, Gris joined their artistic circle and participated in the development of Cubism. In Abstraction (Guitar and Glass), he incorporated objects often used in Cubist still-life painting—musical instruments, newspaper, a glass, and a tabletop. Rather than shatter their forms, however, Gris took a more synthetic approach to the composition. The overlapping planes, flattened appearance, and rhythmic patterns of the painting reinforce the two-dimensional nature of the picture’s surface, while the trompe l’oeil effects, deeply saturated colors, strong light-dark contrasts, and precise definition of forms give the still life an extraordinary physical reality.",

Furthermore, among all his portraits, few equal this likeness in conveying the complex character of the emperor who inherited the Roman world at its greatest extent from his fellow Spaniard Trajan (r. a.d. 98–117). Hadrian traveled widely, visiting most of the provinces during the twenty years of his reign, and commissioned buildings, aqueducts, and roads in many cities. Citizens responded to Hadrian’s generosity by erecting numerous statues in his honor, and after his death they revered him as a god. \nHadrian greatly admired the Greeks. Unlike previous emperors, who were cleanshaven, Hadrian wore a beard, perhaps in emulation of the Greek philosophers whom he so revered. Here Hadrian’s closely cropped beard contrasts with the thick, luxurious curls that frame his face. This sculpture also features an innovative trend in Roman portraiture: the artist carefully sculpted the irises and pupils of the eyes rather than rendering them in paint as was conventional.",

In Nude under a Pine Tree, Pablo Picasso looked to the long tradition of figurative painting, including the female nudes of Francisco de Goya. In contrast to his predecessors, however, Picasso placed the monumental figure on rocky terrain, rather than on a plush chaise. He also used bold, modernist forms that referenced his own earlier artistic styles: the flattened face, segmented legs and torso, and multiple viewpoints recall some of his Cubist works, while the color palette evokes his classical style of the 1920s.",

Between 1937 and 1940, however, Klee regained artistic momentum and produced several hundred paintings and over 1,500 drawings. In these later works, Klee continued to experiment with unusual media and techniques to produce multidimensional effects.

    "tale" : "Édouard Manet was at the peak of his notoriety when the young Henri Fantin-Latour exhibited this portrait at the Salon of 1867. Manet himself chose not to submit any work that year, having had his submission rejected by the 1866 Salon jury. In this commanding image of the great French artist, Fantin portrayed Manet not as a painter, but as a flaneur, a sophisticated man-about-town whose eyes are open to every nuance of modern life. The background of the painting is almost completely blank, both in homage to works by Manet and in emulation of photographic portraits of the period. \nIn 1867, having been regularly rejected by the official Salon, Édouard Manet decided to present a private exhibition of 56 of his works in an independent pavilion close to the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Henri Fantin-Latour’s decision to submit this portrait of his friend—signed “To my friend Manet”—to the Salon that year may have been calculated to play off Manet’s increasing notoriety. A critic admitted that it was hard to reconcile the elegant figure in the portrait with the long-haired bohemian he had imagined Manet to be."

Sharecropper, like many of her other works, shows Catlett’s activism on behalf of African American women in the South, who she believed maintained their dignity in the face of great adversity.",

He was to devote almost half his output as an artist to this subject, observing countless performances and rehearsals at the Paris Opéra. Here he placed the viewer in the wings, as if among the elite Opéra subscribers who roamed and socialized backstage. Dance subjects allowed Degas to contemporize his lifelong interest in showing the human body in complex movement, shifting the scene from ancient history to modern Paris. He finished and signed the present canvas in time for the second Impressionist exhibition, in April 1876.",

His unique merging of Impressionism with a bold, painterly realism was admired for its potency and vigor, which was seen as a healthy antidote to the more delicate styles of many American Impressionists. Afterglow also intrigued contemporary critics for its depiction of the city. Many reviewers questioned whether Lie’s gleaming view of lower Manhattan—especially the monumental buildings of the financial district—was intended as an allegory or as a commentary on American economic power and aspirations. In these readings, the glowing buildings suggest a wondrous city of gold, yet one that remains tantalizingly in the distance."

After finishing it, he painted a variation featuring a nude (a rarity for the artist) in the same pose and setting (1895; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",

Paired images of the mourning Virgin and Christ crowned with thorns, made in the workshop of Dieric Bouts, were an especially successful formulation, judging from the many extant versions. Set against a gold background signifying a timeless, heavenly realm, the Virgin was both an embodiment of compassion and an intercessor for humankind with Christ. No autograph example of this pair by Bouts survives; this exceptionally fine painting of the Virgin was probably made by his son, Dieric Bouts the Younger, who carried on the activity of the workshop after his father’s death.",

His visionary paintings—in particular, those on the theme of the jungle—captivated the art world with their representations of lush plant and animal life painted with incredible detail and precision. Rousseau made The Waterfall in the last year of his life, and it may have been left unfinished: a few leaves on the branches of the tree in the left foreground lack some of the artist’s characteristic overlapping layers of color. Though Rousseau depicted exotic, distant locales, he never set foot outside France. His imaginary scenes were informed by visits to the Paris zoo and botanical gardens, and images from postcards, photographs, and illustrated journals.",

Touring the country with his stepson Jacques Hoschedé, who lived in Christiania (now Oslo), he was awestruck but initially frustrated in his search for good motifs amid the snow. Nevertheless, he painted 29 Norwegian scenes during a two-month stay. These included at least six views of Sandvika, a village near Christiania whose iron bridge may have reminded Monet of the Japanese bridge at his home in Giverny.",

Marc painted The Bewitched Mill following a sojourn to the Italian town of Merano in the southern Tirol. The work’s title refers to the \"magical\" harmony he sensed there between human life, represented by the houses and mill on the left, and nature, embodied by the lyrical region of trees and animals on the right.",

    "origin" : "United States",
    "tale" : "A soap bubble set box (1936, Hartford, Wadsworth Atheneum ; New York 1980–82, pl. 1) was part of Cornell‘s first “theme” installation, in AIfred Barr’s exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1936-37. Cornell called the installation The Elements of Natural Philosophy; it consisted of a glass showcase containing eighty-seven pieces in all, including the box itself. Cornell described this 1936 box as “a real ‘first-born‘ of the type of case that was to become my accepted milieu” (Joseph Cornell, memorandum to Hans Huth, 1953, Archives, The Art Institute of Chicago). In it the spiraling connections between the pipe and “bubbles,” which Cornell metamorphosed into planetary bodies, in this case the moon, are already present. \nIn the present Soap Bubble Set, the white ball resembles either the moon or a bubble. The fragment of coral in the glass introduces the idea of a beach and driftwood; Cornell frequently scoured the beach for flotsam and jetsam thrown up by the tides, even finding there, it seems, clay pipes and glasses (verbal communication to the author from Elizabeth Cornell Benton, Cornell‘s sister, in 1980). Cornell acquired many of the Dutch clay pipes he used in his boxes from the New York World’s Fairs of 1939 and 1940 (Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, in New York 1980–82, p. 100). The deep-blue velvet that covers the box‘s rear wall both creates a night-sky setting for the balls\/planets and hints at the proscenium setting of an old-fashioned, velvet-hung theater. \nThis box was first shown in an exhibition William Copley organized at his Beverly Hills gallery in 1948, the entire contents of which he had bought from Cornell. The show was, in Copley’s words, an “enormous failure.” Copley attributed this to the fact that his installation transformed the gallery into one large box. Plastering the walls and ceiling with the blue-and-white catalogues and scattering clay pipes among the boxes displayed on glass shelves, he created a whole artwork, which he felt inhibited the public from entering (see Bill Copley, “Joseph Cornell,” in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell Portfolio, 1976, exh. cat., n. pag.). Judging from the catalogue of the 1948 show, at least four Soap Bubble Sets were displayed. In the brief catalogue notes, Cornell wrote: \n\"Soap Bubble SetsShadow boxes become poetic theatres or settings wherein are metamorphosed the elements of a childhood pastime. The fragile, shimmering globules become the shimmering but more enduring planets—a connotation of moon and tides – the association of water less subtle, as when driftwood [sic] pieces make up a proscenium to set off the dazzling white of sea-foam and billowy cloud crystalized in a pipe of fancy.\" \nWhen this work was shown by Copley in 1948, it was given the subtitle Spirit Level. While the blue and the white balls on the lower shelf recall heavenly bodies, like moon and planet, the isolated blue marble on the upper shelf indeed recalls the bubble of a spirit level, a device to determine or maintain a level surface, consisting of a bubble suspended in a glass tube full of liquid. The bubble in a spirit level is highly sensitive to minute shifts of orientation, like the balls that roll freely on their glass shelves in the present box. Perhaps the idea of a spirit level was prompted in Cornell‘s mind by his anxiety about the displacement or, as he put it, the “derangement” of the objects in this construction, a concern he expressed in the two typewritten labels on the back of the box (see fig. 4). The subtitle Spirit Level may thus allude to the actions of tilting, adjusting, and straightening the box, with the constant possibility of displacing its delicately disposed contents, in what amounts to a mental as well as physical process. \n— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.50-51.",

Although not intended as a criticism, others used the name to attack this new direction in avant-garde art. The Fauves were not a formally unified group, but their style was nevertheless distinct, characterized by their use of vibrant, unmixed paint and rough, spontaneous brushwork. The thick application, explosive color, and subject of Houses at Chatou—possibly one of the works included in the 1905 Salon—reveal the importance of the work of Vincent van Gogh to the Fauves.",

Boldrini frequently worked from drawings by Titian. This particularly comedic composition suggests that the painter was lampooning the smaller-scale copies based on the Laöcoon that Titian could have seen in Venice. Alternately, the print could reference the contemporary debate over the anatomical similarities between humans and apes, in which Andreas Vesalius’s new research (based on his dissection of human cadavers) clashed with the long-accepted writings of the ancient Greek physician Galen.",

Blown glass became so popular it nearly supplanted ceramic and even bronze wares in the home.",

    "tale" : "The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s Stacks of Wheat in the world.",

    "tale" : "The roots of 20th-century abstract art can be traced to the late 19th century, when artists began to move away from the direct representation of objects toward the communication of emotional states or moods. In doing so, the formal properties of art—such visual elements as line, color, and composition—assumed a primary role in its production. After World War I, many artists, including Piet Mondrian, believed that abstract art could contribute to a more harmonious society by communicating in a universal, visual language. In the wake of the war’s destruction, artists associated with De Stijl (meaning, \"the style\") in the Netherlands recognized the need for a break with the past, as well as a new aesthetic language to correspond to their utopian vision of the world. In 1917 Mondrian joined the De Stijl movement and began to develop a purely visual language of verticals and horizontals, restricting his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black rectilinear lines that framed smaller blocks of primary colors.",

    "tale" : "With this painting of the dance hall known as the Moulin de la Galette, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec established his reputation as the painter-chronicler of the entertainments of Montmartre. In this well-known image, Lautrec employed the wood barrier as a metaphorical divide between the frenzied action of the dance hall, seen as a blur in the background, and the stillness of the bored and waiting women (accompanied by a proprietary male) in the foreground. He used turpentine to thin his paint and applied it in loose washes, a technique known as peinture à l’essence. The result is a seemingly unfinished look that suggests both the immediacy of the artist’s observations and the dinginess of his subject.",

This picture, undertaken around 1860, speaks to his ambition to realize canvases featuring scenes from the Bible, as well as ancient and more recent history. Degas took his subject from the life of Lycurgus, a legendary ninth-century b.c. Spartan lawgiver. Lycurgus’s social reforms included an unusual method of physical training in which adolescent girls competed on an equal footing with boys, exercising nude in public. Degas would have worked up this monochromatic sketch with layers of color had he completed it, but he left it unfinished when he began a second version of the subject (National Gallery of Art, London).",

The symmetrical arrangement of space is intended to create a desired sense of balance, order, and peace. Mrs. Thorne was most likely exposed to Chinese styles through Asian goods that made their way to Europe during the early 17th century. During this time, the East India companies from Holland and England established a monopoly on trade in the region, bringing to Europe blue-and-white ceramics and many other wares.",

It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth.” While working on his London series, he rose early every day to paint Waterloo Bridge in the morning, moving on to Charing Cross Bridge at midday and in the afternoon. He observed both motifs from his fifth-floor window at the Savoy Hotel. The Art Institute’s two Waterloo Bridge paintings are dated 1900 and 1903, but both were likely begun in 1900 and dated only when Monet felt that they were finished. He worked on all of his London paintings in his studio in Giverny, refusing to send any of them to his dealer until he was satisfied with them as an ensemble.",

Here soldiers play cards in the dim interior of a guardhouse, while a page carries the officers’ cloaks. However, the chief subject of the work is the pile of discarded armor, weaponry, and parade gear—a saddle, musket, powder horn, charging spanner, and gauntlets—in the immediate foreground. In treating armor as a still-life subject, Teniers followed the precedent of Jan Breughel the Elder, whose daughter he had married.",

She exhibited this painting as White Rose—Abstraction at Alfred Stieglitz’s Intimate Gallery in 1928 and retitled it Ballet Skirt or Electric Light (from the White Rose Motif) when she lent it to the Art Institute of Chicago’s 1943 retrospective of her work.",

    "tale" : "On Kawara’s work renders the passage of time and one life within its continuum. From 1966 until his death, the artist produced thousands of works in a series called Today. In each, he painted the date (notably, without using stencils) in white on a monochromatic field. While usually not exhibited a newspaper accompanies every work to document the location and context of its execution. Kawara always began and completed these works on the date represented, and if he did not finish a painting on its date, he destroyed it. While following these self-imposed guidelines, Kawara used a set range of canvas sizes for his date paintings.  Oct.31, 1978 is one of only ten works painted at this scale, the largest used in the series.",

Building a large studio and improving his garden, he began a group of monumental paintings of water lilies that he would later offer to the French state. Alongside this project, he painted a suite of 19 smaller canvases, including the present one. There is evidence—including a few photographs of the artist working in his garden—that Monet conceived these paintings outdoors and then reworked them in his studio. By this last stage of his career, however, the distinction between observation and memory in his work is intangible, and perhaps even irrelevant.",

    "tale" : "This is one of a group of related canvases featuring seasonal fruit that Vincent van Gogh painted in the fall of 1887. In these works, he simplified his palette, employed more vibrant colors, and used a thicker, broader paint application than he had earlier. Here he explored the use of complementary colors—yellow and purple, blue and orange, and red and green—in the service of chromatic intensity. The effect of these color contrasts is heightened by the pulsating pattern of brushstrokes that defines the tablecloth and creates a force field around the fruit. The painting was probably among the “violent still lifes”—to quote Van Gogh’s friend the painter Emile Bernard—that he included in the group exhibition of young avant-garde artists that he organized at a local restaurant in November–December 1887.",

Every morning she was photographed naked in the same four stances to record her barely perceptible self-induced weight loss. (The photographs from each day are arranged vertically, and the entire process can be read horizontally, like a filmstrip.) Antin’s performance purposely toyed with the traditional process of Greek sculptors, who were said to find their ideal form by chipping away at a block of marble and discarding any unnecessary material. The artist’s idea of “carving” her own body was inspired by an invitation from the Whitney Museum of Art for its biennial survey exhibition, which at the time restricted itself to the established categories of painting and sculpture, though this work was considered too conceptual for the exhibition.",

He observed both motifs from his fifth-floor window at the Savoy Hotel. The Art Institute’s two Waterloo Bridge paintings are dated 1900 and 1903, but both were likely begun in 1900 and dated only when Monet felt that they were finished.

    "tale" : "Known for an impassioned form of painting predicated on the poetics of color, Mark Rothko was one of the leading proponents of color-field painting, a type of nongestural Abstract Expressionism that entailed large canvases distinguished by monumental expanses of form and tone. The canvas of Untitled (Painting) burns with subtle variations of orange and yellow hues. The painting follows the characteristic format of Rothko’s mature work, according to which stacked rectangles of color appear to float within the boundaries of the canvas. By directly staining the fabric of the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and by paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited his metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to communicate directly the most essential, rawest forms of human emotion. Rothko described his art as the “elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, between the idea and the observer.” In place of overt symbolism, he used color, overwhelming scale, and surface luminosity to elicit an emotive, profound response from the viewer.",

It is one of a group of landscapes featuring the Butte Montmartre, a short climb from the apartment on the rue Lepic where Vincent and Theo lived. Montmartre was dotted with reminders of its quickly receding rural past—abandoned quarries, kitchen gardens, and three surviving windmills, including the Moulin de Blute-Fin. The nonfunctional mill had become a tourist attraction, affording spectacular panoramic views over Paris from the observation tower erected beside it.",

This work was inspired by a contemporary theater piece, which was first performed as a pantomime at a Parisian fair in 1745. The painting’s playfully coy title derives from that of an engraving of a similar image.",

    "artist" : "Balthus",
    "tale" : "Balthus’s legendary secretiveness has inhibited critical commentary on his paintings. His son Stanislas appears at times to have been his spokesman, arguing that the girls in his father’s paintings are \"emblematic archetypes… their very youth the symbol of an ageless body of glory, as adolescence (from the Latin adolescere: to grow toward) aptly symbolizes that heavenward state of growth which Plato refers to in the Timaeus\" (Klossowski de Rola 1983, p. 10). He also suggested, a little more plausibly, that the paintings emphasize the act of seeing, though unfortunately he used this as an excuse to propose that an ideal state can be achieved from their contemplation \"wherein the act of seeing, the seen and the seer become one\" (Klossowki de Rola 1983, p. 8). All the evidence of these senses appealed to in such paintings— nostalgia, lubricity, frustration— work against such a reading. \nMost literature on this painting considers alternative identifications of the cat, with either Balthus’s model, Therese Blanchard, the daughter of a neighbor, or with the artist himself. The latter interpretation is supported by Balthus’s long-standing fascination with cats. In 1920, at the age of thirteen, he published a series of prints narrating the story of a cat called Mitsou; even more directly relevant to the artist’s personal identification with this animal is his 1935 self-portrait entitled  H.M. the King of Cats (New York 1984, no. 9, ill.). In addition in the work of writers in Balthus’s circle, there is considerable support for the association of the cat with sexuality. Georges Bataille’s erotic novel  Histoire de l’oeil (Paris, 1928), for instance, has a chapter entitled \"L’Oeil de chat\" (The Cat’s eye) in which a sixteen-year-old boy and girl engage in sexual play with a cat’s saucer of milk. However, an exclusive emphasis on these readings overstresses the biographical in Balthus’s work and overlooks the degree to which he refers to and plays upon traditions of representing sexuality in Western painting. \nThe genre of salacious images of women with which Balthus’s Girl with Cat is aligned traditionally include a small animal: cat or lap dog. The most famous examples perhaps are  Jean Antoine Watteau’s Lady at Her Toilette of 1716\/17 (London, Wallace Collection) and Edouard Manet’s Olympia of 1865 (Paris, Musee d’ Orsay), but any number of thinly veiled Venuses or clothed beauties in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting carry, fondle, or are watched by a pet. Typical commentaries of the time would remark on how fortunate the pet was to enjoy such privileged proximity to the desired object. Unspoken, but often visually very obvious parallels were also made between the creature and the female body. Traditionally the animal thus has a double identity, related to both the artist\/ voyeur and the female sex. \nThe setting of Girl with Cat has many of the traditional trappings of the painter’s studio. Therese lies on a daybed that figures in several other paintings by Balthus; on the left, the back of an upholstered chair is barely recognizable because of the rococo swatch of blue fabric bunched around one of its arms (similar chairs appear in Balthus’s paintings The White Skirt of 1937 and Therese of 1938). \n— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 6-7.",

    "tale" : "This refined Athenian stamnos (pl. stamnoi) was used to mix water and wine. Also valued for its beauty, this red-figure vessel (so called because the figures remain the natural color of the clay) portrays either Greek women or maenads, female participants in rites celebrating Dionysos, the god of wine. But unlike the frenzied and whirling figures of other Greek vases, these women convey calm, even elegance. This tender serenity, coupled with a softer, somewhat freer form, is a hallmark of the artist (referred to as the Chicago Painter because of this vase) and has been used to identify other works by him, principally similar stamnoi. Working in the potters’ quarter of mid-fifth-century BC Athens, the painter was active during the construction of the Parthenon, the stylistic influence of which can be seen here. He worked closely with a master potter whose vases were individually shaped in a prescribed range of configurations. With refined designs that are gracefully adapted to its shape, this stamnos is a fine example of red-figure painting during the Classical era. It retains its original lid, a rarity among ancient vases.",

    "tale" : "In his work from 1972 to 1983, Jasper Johns used a distinct arrangement of crosshatched marks, traditionally considered a graphic method of adding depth and volume to an image or conveying the illusion of light in space. Johns first glimpsed this pattern on a passing car, recalling: “I only saw it for a second, but knew immediately that I was going to use it. It had all the qualities that interest me—literalness, repetitiveness, an obsessive quality, order with dumbness, and the possibility of a complete lack of meaning.” Emphasizing the flatness of the painting, Johns’s cross-hatching is gestural without being emotive; in this sense, the technique extends his larger critique of overtly expressionist models of painting. Johns forged a new model of painterly abstraction, using a schema that is repeatable and ordered but not strictly geometric or reductive.",

In Elizabeth “Elsie” Swinton’s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder. Swinton was also known for her musical talents; at the time her portrait was executed, she was recognized as an amateur singer and later began performing professionally.",

In the painting the children converse and frolic at the water’s edge on a windy day. There is nothing threatening about the waves or wind; indeed, Potthast’s paintings were both praised and criticized for presenting nothing other than a pleasant, innocent, and optimistic view.",

They also demonstrate a far more homogeneous touch than the freely brushed landscapes of his earlier career, with surfaces that have a tapestry-like materiality.",

Mondrian first sketched this farm around 1905. Nine of the twenty known related paintings and drawings of the farm, however, were created later, during World War I. Mondrian likely returned to the subject because his wartime patrons generally preferred his earlier naturalistic compositions to his recent experiments with Cubism.",

These prints show a crowded marketplace, a vendor at work, a student in deep concentration, and a pair of street musicians. The Yiddish Motifs portfolio was a great success, with the entire edition selling out in just three weeks."

This painting records the last moments of a race, as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top. Unlike traditional sporting artists, who always showed races from the side, Manet dared to compose the scene so that the throng of horses and jockeys thunders straight toward the viewer.",

Nevertheless, the focus on modernity, use of pure, light pigments, and airy brushwork shows how this young artist furthered the most progressive tendencies of “classic” Impressionism. The same year he exhibited this painting he also began making studies of a site directly across the river for his monumental Sunday on La Grande Jatte.",

On this amphora (storage jar) the great hero completes his first assignment—to kill a lion with an invincible hide that was terrorizing the village of Nemea. Here the contest has been decided; Herakles strangles the lion, whose jaws he has pried open with his bare hands. To the right stand Athena and Hermes; on the other stand a nymph and Iolaos, Herakles’s nephew and companion. In subsequent episodes, Herakles often wears the lion’s pelt, either as a headdress or over his arm, as a protective cloak. \nThese vases were used for the transport and storage of items such as wine and olives, and they were given as prizes in athletic competitions. Many vases have been damaged, either in antiquity or in modern times, and repaired. However, this amphora remains intact, with only a few losses, such as the chips on the rim, and some surface abrasion. The vivid white gloss that highlights the women’s skin and the shield is especially well preserved.",

    "tale" : "This small oil on a thin wood panel is one of 24 painted studies Georges Seurat made while conceiving the large, celebrated painting A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Although at first glance, the panel seems close to the larger canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final composition. The trio at right, for example, with the elderly seated figure, was completely rethought in the final composition, in which a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey convey a sense of grand solemnity and wry humor—a sophisticated irony that is completely absent in the clumsily positioned figures of the oil panel.",

Here he depicted his five- or six-year-old son, Jean, playing with a hoop and his wife, Camille, standing in the doorway of their vine-covered house. The pleasant weather and neatly kept garden, a forerunner of the artist’s celebrated garden at Giverny, give a sense of tranquility and well-being to this painting. This was a period of financial security for Monet thanks to recent sales of his work to the Paris art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel.",

In Apples and Grapes, however, he employed the complexity of color, light, and texture found in his most Impressionist landscapes. This is particularly evident in the extensive cloth surface—the play of light on the horizontal brushstrokes (indicating the folds in the tablecloth) recalls earlier canvases in which Monet used similar short horizontals of variegated colors to suggest water rippling in the sunlight.",

The striking colors of the land intrigued her, and she later equated the area’s myriad hues with artist paints: “All the earth colors of the painter’s palette are out there in the many miles of badlands. The light Naples yellow through the ochers—orange and red and purple earth—even the soft earth greens.”",

Pentimenti (underpainting) suggest that in an early stage of the painting, Camille held a bonneted child, presumably the couple’s baby, Jean.",

Van Gogh had seen works by Signac and Georges Seurat in the spring of 1886 at the final Impressionist exhibition. Signac was an eloquent spokesman for Seurat’s pioneering Neo-Impressionism, explaining it as a natural development of Impressionism. Under Signac’s influence, Van Gogh’s palette brightened, his brushstrokes became more varied, and his subject matter expanded. The setting of this work is the Seine River at the Pont de Clichy, near Asnières, where Van Gogh and Signac painted together on several occasions."

Manet painted a nearly identical portrait of Rouvière as Hamlet in 1865, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. He completed the painting and made this print after the actor’s death, possibly as a tribute.",

For this image, Van Gogh copied a wood engraving from Honoré Daumier’s Drinkers, a parody on the four ages of man. The exaggerated figure types capture Daumier’s characteristic humor and convey his sad message about the horrors of alcoholism. The greenish palette may well be an allusion to the notorious alcoholic drink absinthe.",

While the desolation of the nearly featureless landscape gives the composition an overwhelming sense of infinitude, the two distinctly bean-shaped forms in the foreground demonstrate the artist’s continued focus on all things small, which he first outlined in his avant-garde “Poem of Little Things,” published in 1927. In relation to another painting “embellished with a few boiled beans,” Dalí later wrote in his memoir that “one could not imagine swallowing all that unconscious meat without the presence (however uninspiring) of some mealy and melancholy vegetable,” suggesting that he used the bean motif to lighten depictions of potentially sorrowful subjects, a part of his life-long concern with the palatability of his art."

    "tale" : "The Resurrection, the only documented painting by Francesco Buoneri, was commissioned in 1619 by the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, Piero Guicciardini, as one of several altarpieces for his family’s chapel in Florence. In a turn of events that was not uncommon in the rapidly evolving artistic scene of early-17th-century Rome, the painting was rejected by Guicciardini and sold to another collector. The Resurrection exaggerates the bold contrast of light and dark and the realistic treatment of sacred figures that Caravaggio had introduced into Roman painting. Buoneri was apparently one of Caravaggio’s closest followers. He may have been the \"boy Francesco\" who assisted the painter during his last years in Rome, a personal connection suggested by his contemporary nickname, Cecco (for Francesco) del Caravaggio.",

    "tale" : "This pitcher for wine is called an oinochoe, a combination of the Greek oînos, \"wine\" and khéō, \"I pour\". The shiny black glaze is the result of a technique invented by the Etruscans, a powerful ancient civilization in ancient Italy - near modern day Tuscany - with whom the Greeks regularly traded. The glossy black pottery later known as Bucchero ware was made from the 7th century to the late 5th century BC. Produced for both domestic and funerary uses, Bucchero ware was popular locally and across the Mediterranean. Potters achieved the signature shiny black surface by firing the pottery in a reduced-oxygen kiln, where restricted ventilation caused the iron oxide in the coarse Tuscan clay to turn black. Before firing, the clay was burnished, or polished with a smooth stone, resulting in the sought-after sheen, which mimicked the gleam of bronze vessels.",

    "tale" : "After studying in Paris among early Fauve and Cubist artists, and having an influential teaching career in Germany and the United States, Hans Hofmann began to devote himself exclusively to his own painting in 1958. Frustrated by the limits of linear perspective, he introduced his “push-and-pull” theory in order to create a more dynamic sense of space in his paintings, in which forms and colors appear to simultaneously advance and recede. In The Golden Wall, rectangles of varying sizes and colors direct the gaze across the picture. Some forms appear to float above the expressive brushstrokes that punctuate the work, while others are embedded in the background, providing the canvas with a lively sense of movement and dimension.",

    "tale" : "This canvas is the last, largest, and most impressive of four oil paintings of this title; the three other paintings are all dated to 1957 (ill. 851–52, and p. 272, no. 857). There are also five versions of this image in gouache, starting in 1956 and extending to 1964 (ill. In ibid., vol. 4, 1994, p. 193, no. 1421, p. 198, no. 1429, p. 273, no. 1563, and pp. 275–76, nos. 1566 and 1568). Magritte first realized the idea and conceived the title for this series in the first of these gouaches completed in 1956 shortly after he announced to Mirabelle Dors and Maurice Rapin, in a letter of November 9, 1956, that “Le Banquet” was one of his latest “finds” (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 267). The little sketch in this letter shows the main motif of the sun visible before a clump of trees set in an unspecified landscape. In the first oil version (as in the earlier related image, The Sixteenth of September, 1956, location unknown; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254, no. 834, ill., which shows the crescent moon on a large tree), the clump of trees is set in a meadowlike clearing dotted with large stones. In the second oil version of The Banquet, as in the Bergman canvas, the woodland glade is replaced with a stone parapet or balustrade, whose top is lit by the sun’s rays. This feature suggests a parklike setting, a domesticated concept of nature suited to Magritte’s deadpan, realist style. The proportions of the objects in relation to one another also differ from canvas to canvas; in the picture under dis­cussion, the sun looms larger in relation to the trees than in other versions and appears therefore closer to the viewer. It is interesting that, although the motif in essential respects is identical, significant variations mark each version as a distinct image.  \nThe Banquet series is a development of another se­ries on which Magritte had started working in February 1956 and which he called The Place in the Sun. In these pictures, Magritte focused on the Surrealist idea of displacement, but with a particular twist. One object was superimposed on another larger one to which it was unrelated. The original series included an image of a seated scribe superimposed on an apple (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, pp. 252–53, no. 833, ill.) and Sandro Botticell’s Primavera silhouetted against a figure in a bowler hat seen from behind (ibid., vol. 3, 1998, p. 258, no. 837, ill.). Magritte’s approach in these pictures resembled what he referred to as “Objective stimulus,” a term he applied to those instances in which he replaced an object familiar to a particular context with one related to it but out of place, as he did in his 1933 painting Elective Affinities of a huge egg in a birdcage (Paris, E. Perier; Sarah Whitfield, Magritte, London, The Hayward Gallery, 1992, exh. cat., no. 60, ill., n. pag.). As he explained to Rapin, The Place in the Sun is if you like an ‘Objective stimulus’ with the difference that the image which comes ‘on’ another has a still greater charge of strangeness (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253). In a subsequent letter to Dors and Rapin, Magritte wrote of The Sixteenth of September, “I have continued with my ‘Places in the Sun’ but by now the title is no longer suitable for a big tree in the evening with a crescent moon above it!” (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254). The object that would have been hidden (crescent moon, sun) is now visible, hiding part of the object that would have hidden it.  \nThese works are striking examples of Magritte’s interest in the categories of the visible and the invisible. In a letter to André Bosmans of September 25, 1964, Magritte explained: \n With regard to “the invisible,” I understand that which is not visible, for example; heat, weight, pleasure, etc. There is the visible that is seen: the apple on the face in The Great War, and the visible that is hidden: the face hidden by the visible apple. In The Banquet the sun hidden by the curtain of trees is, itself, visible (René Magritte, Lettres à André Bosmans, 1958-1967, ed. by Francine Perceval, Brussels, 1990, p. 383).  \nAccording to the above criteria, the sun hidden by trees is an example of the “visible that is hidden.” In the Banquet series, Magritte carried the implications of these reflections one step further: he actually rendered the sun visible by creating a visual conundrum, in which the sun is not displaced from its customary context, but rendered strange.  \nAt this time Magritte seems to have been interested, moreover, in the varying quality of light at different times of day. Of the second version of The Sixteenth of September (1956, Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 257, no. 836, ill.), he wrote to Dors and Rapin on August 6, 1956: “I have just painted the moon on a tree in the gray-blue colors of evening” (ibid.). In the Bergman version of The Banquet, the strong red glow of the setting sun is framed by the darkening landscape, a naturalistic effect that further dramatizes the “charge of strangeness” (Magritte, quoted in ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253).  \nThe Bergman painting also has a strong formal quality, with the sun as a pure circle in the center, balanced by the strong architectural horizontal of the balustrade. In this respect, the picture recalls Max Ernst’s Forest series of the late 1920s (Ernst Katalog, vol. 3, pp. 180-209, nos. 1140-96, ills.), where the circular forms of sun or moon work pictorially in both an abstract and figurative sense.  \n–Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1997), pp. 172–74, cat. 86.",

    "tale" : "The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s Stacks of Wheat in the world.",

Although he specialized in engraved portraits, he also made prints after other artists, such as this charming portrait of N.

Carved by the sculptor Praxiteles in the 4th century B.C. from fine marble, it enjoyed great renown as the first devotional statue of a female goddess in the nude. It produced an immediate sensation when it was installed in a sacred precinct on the island of Knidos, and, centuries later, it inspired Roman artists to re-create the celebrated image of the goddess. Although the earlier Greek sculpture no longer exists, Roman statues such as this inform us of its likely appearance. However, the function of these later Roman versions was fundamentally different from that of the earlier Greek work: what had once been an object of veneration among the Greeks became a favorite garden ornament for wealthy Romans. Adapted for such a use, the badly marred surface of the statue is the result of prolonged exposure to the elements.",

The themes of Thanksgiving, rural customs, and family life, which Lee painted in a deliberately folksy manner, would have had great appeal to a country still in the midst of the Depression. Yet Josephine Logan, the donor of the prize, condemned the work’s broad, exaggerated style, founding the conservative “Sanity in Art” movement in response. This controversy only brought Lee fame, and Thanksgiving has been recognized as one of the most popular nostalgic views of this American ritual since that time.",

To the right of her, women dance the upaupa, a suggestive ancient Tahitian dance that missionaries and colonial authorities tried to suppress. In a middle ground of pink sand sits a female bather flanked by ambiguously gendered figures lying on their sides. Although the arrangement of this trio seems symbolic—perhaps of birth, life, and death—Gauguin made its exact meaning an enigma.",

Although known more for her flower paintings, she frequently depicted leaves, inspired by the examples she found on her walks around Lake George in upstate New York, where she summered with her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, between 1918 and 1928. In Yellow Hickory Leaves with Daisy, O’Keeffe painted the leaves around the small white daisy at lower center so that they seem to be emanating from the flower. She hoped that the strangely magnified subjects would inspire viewers to, as she said, “be surprised into taking time to look at” them in a new way."

Although there is a general suggestion of landscape, here the process of painting became primary, expressing the power of spontaneous action and chance effects. The resulting abstraction, with its expressive, gestural appearance, prefigured the allover compositions of Pollock’s celebrated drip paintings, which debuted the following year.",

    "tale" : "Two years before she received her first camera, Diane Arbus wrote: “There are and have been and will be an infinite number of things on Earth. Individuals all different, all wanting different things, all knowing different things, all loving different things, all looking different… . That is what I love: the differentness.” Arbus’s appreciation for the unusual, eccentric, and extraordinary led her to photograph a range of subjects over the thirty years of her career—transvestites, giants, art philanthropists, nudists, and, as here, identical twins. No one knows how Arbus learned about a small-town Christmas party in 1967 being held for local twins and triplets, but it is in keeping with her interest in how people are who they are. Isolating these seven-year-old girls against the wall of the Knights of Columbus hall in Roselle, New Jersey, and photographing them in her typically straightforward manner, Arbus ensured close attention would be paid to the details: the matching homemade dresses (which were green but appear black), the lace stockings bunched below the knees, and the barely discernible difference in each girl’s presentation before the camera. Such details variously belie and reinforce the uncanny suggestion of two thoroughly identical individuals.",

In a letter to the sculptor Auguste Rodin describing his efforts to translate into paint the brilliant Mediterranean light, Monet declared he was \"fencing, wrestling, with the sun.\" In other letters, he complained of the impossibility of finding a motif due to the abundant vegetation. In this sun-drenched composition painted from a hilltop vantage point, the sea is barely visible through the interlaced trunks of local pine trees."

Jeff Koons explained: “There’s a snorkel and somebody is doing something to her under the water because she’s grabbing her breasts for protection. But the viewer also wants to victimize her.” The cartoonlike rendering of the form belies the exquisite hard-paste porcelain finish, typical of 18th-century Rococo figurines. Part of his Banality series, which is characterized by oddly eroticized, comic, and kitsch images, this work demonstrates Duchampian and Pop Art strategies of appropriation and, combining imagery from multiple sources, makes the primary subject taste itself.",

Attracted to the region’s landscape and peasant communities, the artist specialized in scenes featuring women in traditional dress set among voluptuous, blooming flowers. Here, Hitchcock revised the environment behind the Dutch flower seller, editing out other houses nearby in favor of a bucolic vista. Although he employed academic techniques such as fine modeling of his figures, Hitchcock nevertheless earned a reputation as a daring colorist for the brilliant hues and open brushwork that likewise characterize his compositions."

    "tale" : "This cup was shaped to fit easily in the drinkers hand, and was likely used as part of the Greek symposium. Much like modern academic symposiums, in which people discuss a topic of common interest, debunking old theories and putting forth new hypotheses; the men of ancient Athens regularly got together in private homes to exchange ideas. Afterward the participants might continue the conversation, discussing their impressions in greater detail or simply socializing over a drink. As the evening progressed, participants engaged in other pleasures, including games, performances, and sex. Wine played a major role in fueling these evenings, and as such the myriad vessels used in the symposium often paid homage to drink. \nHere, the god of wine Dionysos rides astride a donkey. Before and behind him satyrs - the gods half man half goat companions - are visually aroused by the scene; while a Maenad - their female counterpart - leads the procession while strumming a lyre. The background of this scene is decorated with winding vines, enforcing the themes of wine, revelry and music.",

    "tale" : "This large handled jar held the water used to dilute large quantities of wine in preparation for the Greek symposium. It was considered uncivilized for a Greek to consume undiluted wine, so water was fetched from a public fountain house in a jar like this one. The horizontal handles made it easier to carry, while the vertical handle at the back was used for pouring. \nOn the front of this vase, the hero Hercules wrestles Triton - the messenger of the sea who is depicted as a merman - as a man and a woman look on. They are likely Nereus and Triton’s mother Amphitrite, but we cannot be certain. The intricate composition has the Greek hero astride the monster, his arms locked around Triton’s neck in an implacable grip, while Triton flails his arms, black fingers stretched against the red background. They face different directions-Herakles to the viewers’ right and up, victorious, and Triton to the left and down, vanquished. Precise incision renders the outline and details of the lion skin that Herakles wears, as well as the contour and detail of Triton’s scales and fins. Above this scenethe artist has written kalo[s]p[u]this – or \"Pythis [is] beautiful\"; exactly who Pythis is is another mystery. \nOn the shoulder of the vessel, the area above the front scene on the flat surface between the handles, another mythological scene plays out. This time it is the judgement of Paris, in which the handsome youth must judge a beauty contest between three goddesses - Aphrodite, Hera and Athena (shown seated). Aphrodite famously wins the contest by promising Paris the love of the most beautiful woman in the world. The woman in question turns out to be Helen of Troy, whose love affair with Paris would set in motion the deadly Trojan war.",

Water Lily Pond was among the 18 similar versions of the motif that he made in 1899–1900; their common theme was the mingling of the lilies with reflections of other vegetation on the pool’s surface."

Other attributes of Jerome abound: the robe and hat in the foreground signify his appointment to the office of cardinal under Pope Damascus I, the glasses and book represent his learned character, and the lion in the distant background recalls the legend that Jerome once pulled a thorn out of the beast’s paw."

    "tale" : "In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband’s death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet’s sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hoschedé and her children: \"How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!\" He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in Cliff Walk at Pourville are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hoschedé daughters. In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women’s wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.",

She was drawn to the theories of the Russian Expressionist painter Vasily Kandinsky, who, in his 1912 text Concerning the Spiritual in Art, argued that visual artists should emulate music in order to achieve pure expression free of literary references.",

Andromeda’s nudity is accentuated by her flowing locks, blown dramatically by the wind and waves; she is a comely tidbit for monster or man. Saenredam’s early training was in cartography, and his rendition of Goltzius’s sea beast resembles the hybrid stock characters that populate dangerous uncharted waters of 16th-century maps.",

By his early death at age 29 he had created his own market niche of animal portraiture, leading the way for 18th-century artists such as George Stubbs, who would paint literal portraits of prized livestock for their proud owners."

    "tale" : "One of the first objects to enter the Art Institute’s collection, this amphora represents changes in conservation practices across different centuries. Before it was acquired by the museum in the 19th century, the vessel had broken and been repaired. The staples that hold the foot together are from this early restoration. Some fragments were missing, including important parts of the figural scene depicting the battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. Because filling in these areas would require imaginative reconstruction, these areas of loss were not restored. The lower decorative band, a uniform key pattern, was restored. 20th-century restoration with matte black plaster indicates areas of loss in the band. The fragments of this amphora were reassembled in an earlier century using pieces of other ceramic vessels, but this amphora was left intact by conservators.",

Merope, the youngest sister, married Sisyphus and hid herself in shame because he was mortal. The sculpture depicts the outcast Merope as she seeks her celestial family. With its unclothed torso, The Lost Pleiade is the closest Rogers came to creating a complete nude. Although a conteporary viewers may not have understood the reference to Fasti, the title nonetheless reassured Victorian audiences that this partially nude woman had literary antecedents and was thus not intended as a sensual form."

Salmoneus, king of Elis, pretended to be Zeus by imitating the sound of thunder and the appearance of lightning. Angered at his impudence, here Zeus strikes Salmoneus dead with a real lightning bolt.",

    "tale" : "This ancient storage vessel is decorated in the black-figure technique, which was developed in Corinth and used widely during the Archaic period (700–480 BCE). Gloss, a slip made from refined clay, was applied to all areas intended to be black. For the figural scene the silhouettes of the figures and other elements were painted in gloss, sometimes following the lines of a preliminary sketch scratched into the surface. Using a sharp tool, the artist created details by incising through the gloss to the light clay ground below. Colors such as purple-red and white, made from a gloss with mineral pigments, were then added. After a three-stage firing process applying alternately less and more oxygen, the gloss turned black. In its finest form, it was quite shiny. On this vessel, those techniques are used by the artist to create lively scenes in which a woman dances playfully with a drape of fabric, perhaps her cloak. Male musicians accompany her with Greek instruments including a Barbiton (the string instrument which looks like a small harp) and an aulos (the wind instrument shaped like a doubled flute). The inquisitive dog adds to the sense of movement and rhythym within the scene.",

In Wilde’s tale, Dorian Gray commissions a portrait of himself as an attractive young man and later trades his soul for an ever-youthful appearance. As the still-handsome Gray leads an increasingly dissolute and evil life, his painted representation rots and decays, revealing the extent of his moral corruption. Albright’s renown as a painter of the macabre made him the ideal choice of Albert Lewin, the director of the movie, to paint the horrific image of Gray. Although the movie was shot in black and white, Lewin filmed the painted portrait in color to emphasize Gray’s shocking transformation.",

    "tale" : "Luigi Rossini trained as an architect in Bologna before moving to Rome in 1813, where he had more success as an artist. Following in the footsteps of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Rossini began a series of etchings of Rome’s constructed marvels. His extensive knowledge of structural design proved valuable for his accurate, detailed portrayals of sites such as the antique arch of Septimus Severus. Whereas Piranesi tended to exaggerate his scenes, Rossini remained grounded in his realistic representations. Because Rossini’s depictions are so precise, his prints serve as important records of Rome’s architectural heritage.",

The site became the museum’s permanent home at the conclusion of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, where the new structure had hosted lectures and other events for fairgoers. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation’s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail. For the Art Institute, he modeled larger-than-life African lions, the one positioned north of the steps “on the prowl” (1893.1b) and the lion to the south “in an attitude of defiance,” in Kemeys’s words. These behavioral distinctions are visible in the variation of head, tail, and stance. Each weighing in at more than two tons, the Lions were cast in Chicago by the American Bronze Founding Company.",

A knight took care to protect his mount, on which he was dependent for the mobility and speed required in both attack and retreat. In Roman times, some heavy cavalry used armor made of iron or bronze scales to protect their horses. From the twelth century on, knights covered their steeds in bands of iron mail (a network of interlocking rings). By the fifteenth century, full-plate armors were not uncommon. This shaffron, or headpiece, is etched in gilt bands with decoration on a finely dotted ground. Riveted between the eyes is an elongated conical spike, perhaps inspired by the horn of the mythical unicorn. A manifestation of great power and wealth, the shaffron has been valued for centuries as an object of beauty, not just as a tool of warfare and sport.",

The powerful Nur Jahan had immense financial resources at her disposal. Built between 1622 and 1628 and modest in size, as befitted the mausoleum of a nobleman rather than an emperor, the structure is lavish in its use of semiprecious stones, and the workmanship and design are of unsurpassed quality. In its exclusive use of white marble, it antedates the Taj Mahal and is considered by many to be the finer monument. \nThis drawing was created in the Company style, named after the British East India Company, which spearheaded English mercantile and political interests in the subcontinent from the early seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. The British were eager to record and catalogue everything they saw. In the absence of photography, first British and later Indian artists, who excelled in drawing and painting fine details, recorded the sights. The style arose in the later part of the eighteenth century and ended in the mid-nineteenth with the beginning of photography. In addition to architectural drawings, other subjects included animal and botanical studies, occupations and trades, regional dress, festivals, and scenes of village life.",

    "tale" : "Chung Sang-Hwa’s signature technique entails a repetitive process of applying and then removing paint, so that each work comprises both positive and negative space, with raw canvas as much a part of its structure as the paint itself. Considered representative of the Korean Tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Chung’s works are thus defined not by any single choice of color but instead by how they were made. Indeed, many products of the movement were referred to as pangbop—“methods” — rather than as paintings; the centrality of method or process led Korean art critic Yi Kyung-Sung to describe Tansaekhwa works in terms of drawing with, spreading, bleeding, spilling, and pushing paint, for instance. \nUntitled, 72-12-A is one of Chung’s key transitional works, among the first in which he initially employed uniform, allover applications of paint before then peeling and scraping some of it away. The resulting canvas was then covered from edge to edge by two different kinds of marks: those that remain from the first white coats and the similarly sized “strokes” made by pulling paint away. These latter gestures sometimes expose the loosely woven brown canvas support and at other times reveal underlayers of different white paints—some matte, some shiny, some off-white, and some faintly yellow. The large scale of this simultaneously random and exacting composition raises issues of labor, intensity, and intention. At the same time, the very idea of a composition is thrown into question: Chung filled his canvas evenly and without emphasis, often shifting it as he worked in order to ensure a kind of noncompositional unity across the entire field of the painting."

Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20). In 1922 Schindler left Wright’s firm to establish his own practice in Los Angeles, where his commissions were mostly residential buildings. His iconic King’s Road Home (1922) and the Lovell Beach House (1926) set the tone for the experimentation with common building materials that is now typical of many Los Angeles–based practitioners such as Frank O. Gehry and Morphosis, who are reshaping the formal characteristics of architecture.",

Although trained as a painter, as early as the 1930s Saitō began a series of controversial plywood reliefs that were difficult to classify as either painting or sculpture, as those conventional categories were understood at the time. Much of his work was then lost or destroyed during World War II, but Saitō gradually made his way back to the wall-relief format, producing his best-known and intensely physical works—the painted, gouged, and drilled wood panels of the 1960s. \n“The ideal is a painting surface that can stand up to the real, concrete colors that have quality and strength,” Saitō once said, insisting that paintings themselves must be understood to—or must be made to—“solidly exist.” In 1960 he first used a power drill to scar the surface of his works; the small circular depressions in this relief were produced by the carefully controlled pressure of such a drill, at once an act of aggression against the previously flat surface of the panel and also a gesture of decoration or elaboration. In this complex composition, the irregular grid of drilled depressions is counterbalanced by the sleek white curved elements collaged around them. Meanwhile the vibrant, almost velvety blue paint appeals as much to a viewer’s sense of touch as to her eye.",

    "tale" : "Ibrahim El-Salahi swiftly became one of the most influential artists working in Sudan after the country gained independence in 1956. His paintings combine African motifs, Islamic calligraphy, and Euro-American modernism. A member of the revolutionary Khartoum school, El-Salahi contributed to the intellectual climate of postcolonial Sudan and the making of a national art and aesthetic in the 1960s. His work is characterized by the use of earthy colors, the transformation of Arabic letters into abstracted forms, and the merging of folk art with modern abstract painting. The artist once described the “Pandora’s box” of animal, plant, and, more specifically, skeletal and masked forms that seemed to open for him as he deconstructed and abstracted the shapes of written language; he was also inspired by the structure of West African masks. \nA radically abstracted figure—holding a pomegranate in its right hand—plays a prominent role in Male-Female Figure and the Pomegranate. Just as striking, however, is the material surface of the work, with its array of intricate textures. This painting exemplifies the artist’s innovations of the 1960s both in its compositional complexity and its evident engagement with process. El-Salahi used enamel and oil paint as well as a technique he called “tickling,” which involved manipulating the canvas with his fingers to create the appearance of depth. Discussing this painting, he has said, “I did it in Sudan, at a time when I was focusing on … somber relations. I started by building the image with a mixture of white oil and enamel paints, then treated it with a glaze of burnt sienna and black oil paints mixed with linseed oil. I used an old canvas, which after some time I had rolled so that the paint would crack, because that was the effect I wanted.”",

    "tale" : "Nilima Sheikh combines traditional forms of Asian painting with contemporary political content. The artist’s recent series of scroll-like canvases takes as its focus Kashmir, a region fissured by the Line of Control between India and Pakistan. The two countries maintain an uneasy peace, broken periodically by wars. \nA stirring evocation of the area, this series followed a set of smaller works (2003) titled The Country without a Post Office after Agha Shahid Ali’s 1997 book of poetry of the same name. The artist’s desire to move away from the restrictive binary of Hindu–Muslim conflict led her to focus instead on the cosmopolitanism of the Silk Road, the series of trade routes that linked Kashmir to Central Asia, China, and Europe in antiquity. This historical perspective is reflected in Sheikh’s imagery and in the use of the painted scroll format. Suspended from the ceiling so as to be visible from both sides, the works capture the composite culture of the Kashmir Valley through palimpsestic episodes, layering richly colored passages of figuration and script. \nWe Must Bear, which Sheikh painted specifically for a solo exhibition at the Art Institute, comments not only on the troubles that have beset the Kashmir Valley since 1989, but also on the ongoing hardships its residents have borne over the centuries. The work is based on a quotation from a sixteenth-century verse by Nund Rishi (Sheikh Nuruddin Nurani), which can be seen at upper left. Kashmiris’ struggles are reflected by the weight of the body that the central figure is carrying across a field strewn with images of loss and war.",

    "tale" : "The emperors of China’s last dynasty, the Qing, were enamored of exquisitely decorative objects and recruited remarkable craftsmen to serve their court. During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as doucai (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.",

Central to all his endeavors was a holistic understanding of the universe and a desire to use science and technology in a sustainable manner to better serve mankind and the planet. Fuller coined the term dymaxion to label his inventions that applied available technology to provide the greatest possible efficiency. In 1927 he began investigating designs that would revolutionize transportation. Fuller used existing automotive parts and boat and airplane technology to design the Dymaxion Car, which debuted to an awed public at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The aerodynamic bullet shape and lightweight aluminum chassis enabled the car to reach speeds of 120 miles per hour, and consumed thirty miles per gallon. The three-wheeled vehicle had exceptional maneuverability due to its rear-wheel drivetrain. Fuller refined the design in the 1940s, but a prototype proved prohibitively expensive to manufacture. Although considered too radical to mass-produce at the time, Fuller’s Dymaxion Car presaged many features considered standard in today’s automobiles."

    "tale" : "Zhang Wei was a critical figure in the development of avant-garde art in China. Self-trained, he began his career as a key member of the No Name Art Group, which was the most significant clandestine artists’ group formed in the early 1970s. After leaving its ranks in 1979, Zhang became one of the first artists in the country to make abstract paintings following the Cultural Revolution. His approach to abstraction is grounded in his knowledge of traditional Chinese ink painting, in which an emphasis is placed on expressing emotion through the gestural movement of the brush. \nAC10 depicts two glowing amorphous turquoise forms on a raw linen plane. The color is at once translucent and delicately built up. Zhang was interested in producing an allover composition in which the viewer cannot identify where that artist had begun or ended his mark making. He has discussed this particular painting with reference to power and art, remarking, “The big blue painting that I painted in 1984—the one I love so much! … I borrowed that [concept of power] from the Chinese traditional mentality. There is this Chinese saying, ‘power is formless.’ That’s my language too.” Formless power is an apt description of the whole of Zhang’s practice; from his first painting, his art has always been subversive. He worked always outside of China’s official arts institutions, first as part of the No Name Art Group and later when he used his apartment as a makeshift salon and art gallery. In so doing, he became influential within the underground art movement of the early 1980s.",

The design of this fragment is vibrant and sophisticated, setting an intricate geometric pattern against a lustrous satin-weave ground. The pattern joins white trilobed arches with a repeat design of green hop blossoms, stylized vegetal motifs, and yellow scrolling ornaments that recall the lush interior settings of the Alhambra, an extensive royal complex overlooking the city of Granada. These elements are closely connected to architectural decoration—especially stuccowork and wall tiles—and they were shared by potters, stucco carvers, and weavers. In impressive condition, this textile presents a clear sense of the luxury and splendor of Nasrid palace interiors.

Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20). In 1922 Schindler left Wright’s firm to establish his own practice in Los Angeles, where his commissions were mostly residential buildings. His iconic King’s Road Home (1922) and the Lovell Beach House (1926) set the tone for the experimentation with common building materials that is now typical of many Los Angeles–based practitioners such as Frank O. Gehry and Morphosis, who are reshaping the formal characteristics of architecture.",

Once belonging to a set of two, this splendid piece of Brussels lace may have been made for the Sun King himself shortly before his death. This type of bobbin part-lace, initially produced in Brussels during the eighteenth century, consists of individual motifs made separately but joined together so skillfully that the seams are almost imperceptible.

At center are a rooster and trophies, beneath which is the king’s monogram of double Ls.

Armed female warriors appear to the right and left, and gracing the upper corners are the Maltese cross and the sun, the latter the emblem of Louis.",

Executed with different angles of the paintbrush and multiple layers and varied densities of ink, paintings of such careful synthesis and sketch-like spontaneity describe what the artist Huang Binhong called “the order of disorder.” \nHuang, who is recognized as one of China’s greatest twentieth-century masters, helped reinvigorate that country’s tradition of literati painting. He disdained stereotypical themes and styles that had become increasingly prevalent since the eighteenth century and looked to earlier artists for inspiration. Indeed, the inscription on this painting alludes to brushstrokes of “broken ink” demonstrated by eminent masters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. \nIts limited use of color and caricature-like simplicity suggest that this painting dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s. By then, Huang had reached the pinnacle of his painting career and simultaneously distinguished himself as a connoisseur, scholar, poet, and publisher. Exceptional in his passion for and knowledge of both Western and Chinese art, he corresponded with Western intellectuals who appreciated his insights on the principles as well as practice of Chinese painting. They included Lucy Catherine Driscoll, a lecturer in art history and aesthetics at the University of Chicago, who had begun her career at the Art Institute as an educator and administrator.",

    "tale" : "This elegant piece epitomizes the Late Baroque style that flourished in Newport, Rhode Island. It is one of six bureaus that can be attributed to the celebrated cabinetmaker John Townsend on the basis of similar construction and design features in labeled pieces by the maker. For example, the carved shells have central C-scrolls featuring petals and crosshatched baskets, all motifs that are indicative of Townsend’s work. In addition, the top is integrated into the case by cove-and-bead molding, with smaller cavetto molding underneath. The blocking of the upper drawer continues through the side drawers and into the graceful double scroll of the bracket feet, creating an unbroken visual plane that unifies the design elements. \nKept in bedchambers, bureau tables most likely functioned as dressing tables. They were particularly popular among the Quaker citizens of Newport, who appreciated the wide array of storage possibilities they offered. According to oral tradition, Samuel Fowler originally owned this bureau. A successful merchant, Fowler frequently conducted business with the Townsend family. In 1786 and 1787, John Townsend purchased hinges, nails, and sundries from Fowler. This relationship bolsters the argument that Fowler owned this bureau, since patronage loyalty resulting from familial, religious, and trading ties was typical in eighteenth-century Newport.",

His decidedly unimposing, antiheroic works explore the cultural, economic, historical, and social conditions of his native Germany with a detached, often humorous, sensibility. Much of Schütte’s work addresses the almost existential difficulty postwar German artists encounter in attempting to create monuments and memorials. As such, it evidences an ongoing preoccupation with themes of death, mourning, and collective memory. This is true of Urns, an installation comprising eight ceramic vessels glazed in a palette of solid colors marked by streaks, drips, and other surface effects. Ranging from three to five feet in height, these fragile containers at once imply living bodies and oversize repositories for their ashes. The vessels are intended to be grouped together, like a family. Displayed closed, these mysterious containers prompt speculation about what might be contained inside. One of the urns, however, lacks a top and bottom; viewing the installation from above reveals that it is empty.",

Usually early in the morning, Atget hauled a large view camera, a wood tripod, and heavy glass plates around the city to do his work. In Fête du trône, the photographer captured a curious window display featuring articles associated with a giant and a midget, a sort of ready-made Surrealism. In 1925, the year this photograph was taken, Atget was discovered by the expatriate American artist and photographer Man Ray, who was part of the Surrealist circle of poets and artists in Paris. With Man Ray’s support, Atget’s work began to be published and recognized as more than just a visual history of Paris. Upon Atget’s death, Man Ray’s assistant, the photographer Berenice Abbott, acquired the more than eight thousand prints found in his studio and devoted decades to promoting his vast and remarkable oeuvre. The funds for Abbott’s purchase were supplied by Julien Levy, a prominent dealer of photography and Surrealism, the core of whose photographic collection is held at the Art Institute."

    "tale" : "The setting for the painting is the royal stables in Isfahan. The upper portion of the scene consists of a platform on which are gathered the shah, or Persian king, who appears next to the column on the right; five kneeling courtiers; and various attendants serving fruit and wine. The king is identified in the artist’s signature at the upper left as Shah ‘Abbas II, who died in 1666, but it is possible that the undated painting was executed after his death. The ruler’s status is emphasized by his golden halo and by the opulent gold and jeweled vessels placed before him. The lower portion shows a roundup of horses who bear the trident-like royal brand on their flanks; they move in a spiral that coils counterclockwise from the upper right. The scene bursts with energy and looks chaotic—a brawl is taking place at the lower left—but the courtiers and handlers seem to be getting control of the animals. The figures on the platform, meanwhile, pay no attention to the commotion below. \nThe painting represents a new journalistic, even anecdotal approach to Persian painting introduced in the second half of the seventeenth century. The viewer gets the sense that the work may record a specific moment in daily life at court and that it was observed firsthand. Figures no longer conform to stock types but are highly individualized by facial features and dress. Standing just to the right of center in the upper part of the roundup scene is a man wearing a gold, fur-lined, armless jacket. He holds a list and is writing notes while conferring with a young man in a blue robe. The man taking notes may well be the supervisor of the royal stud, one of whose responsibilities was to inspect the king’s stables and keep an inventory of the animals."

    "tale" : "“Make no little plans,” Daniel H. Burnham reputedly exclaimed around the time he unveiled his Plan of Chicago, the first comprehensive metropolitan plan in the United States. Providing the vocabulary for Chicago architecture through the 1920s, the project was the legacy of Burnham, whose renown in large-scale city planning began when he was chief of construction for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. Commissioned by the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan was developed with the assistance of architect Edward H. Bennett, who elaborated parts of it after Burnham’s death in 1912 and was responsible for executing many of its recommendations. Emulating the grand classical design of European cities, Chicago was to become “a Paris by the Lake.” Features included the development of Chicago’s lakefront and Lake Shore Drive, the construction of Grant Park, and the transformation of Michigan Avenue into a premier commercial boulevard following the completion of the Michigan Avenue bridge. Eleven of the seventeen perspective views were rendered by Burnham’s frequent collaborator, the Beaux-Arts-trained Jules Guérin. The draftsman’s stunning, impressionistic views, with their unusual perspectives and dramatic use of color, bring the Plan of Chicago to life, imbuing it, as Burnham stated about his own aims, with the “magic to stir men’s blood.”",

This cabinet’s triangular form, with its serpentine door, is supported on short, fluted legs that are shod with ivory on the two front feet and terminate at the knees with a scroll flourish. Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann employed ebony and ivory to depict the large urn from which an abundance of stylized flowers and leaves cascades, overflowing the limits of the container to form a black-and-white oval that contrasts with the warm tone of the amboyna wood.",

    "inscription" : "unknown",
    "tale" : "The Paminggir aristocracy employed a type of ritual hanging commonly known as a ship cloth, a name that refers to one of the principal motifs of such textiles. These hangings display a very limited repertoire of patterns, including one or two red ships, a single blue ship, tree images, buildings, and rows of stylized anthropomorphic figures. The indigenous name for textiles of this type, palepai, probably goes back to the old Javanese word lepih, which means “to fold” or “to double.” Palepai served as markers of status and perhaps even denoted descent. Indeed, title, claim to leadership, and certain other privileges accompanied the possession of palepai. These textiles were also important requisites during rites of passage, such as marriage, death, or accession to a higher rank—events that were thought to be unstable moments fraught with danger. The ship images that appear on this palepai would have indicated an appropriate agent of safe conduct from one stage of life to another. The red vessels are also understood to represent the upper world, the abode of the ancestors, which can be reached by the ship of death. Since the Lampung economy was based on sea trade, ships served as symbols of wealth and power as well.",

    "tale" : "This imposing, colossal head was once part of an eight-foot-tall kneeling deity from a set of fifty-four statues that lined one side of a causeway leading up to the south entry of the Bayon Temple at the imperial Khmer capital of Angkor Thom, in Angkor, Cambodia. Although the temple was built by the powerful king Jayavarman VII (1181-1218), a follower of Buddhism, some scholars believe that the statues illustrate the Hindu myth of the Churning of the Ocean of Milk. Both the gods and the demons on the opposite side of the causeway hold the giant serpent Vasuki in their arms in a tug of war to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality. Another interpretation is that the statues represent guardian figures, with the symbolic protection of the snake, separating and delimiting the world of the sacred from that of the profane. The gods and demons both frown protectively as they guard the entrance to the temple, but they are distinguishable by the shape of their eyes and their headgear. The gods, as demonstrated by this head, have almond eyes, a diadem, long earrings, and a conical chignon decorated with five rows of lotus leaves. The demons have round eyes, furrowed brows, long hair, and fantastical headdresses. An architectural masterpiece, Angkor Thom illustrates the syncretic relationship of the Hindu and Buddhist belief systems of Southeast Asia.",

    "tale" : "It is not surprising that early American textiles reflect the strong influence of European, especially English, designs and techniques. Materials were scarce and making utilitarian objects such as bedcoverings depended entirely on raw products that could be raised by a family or community. Yet indigenous forms of American needlework did develop, as can be seen in this masterful bed rug. Although the coiling tendrils of its design are reminiscent of motifs that appear in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English textiles, their application to a bedcovering and the technique of looped running stitches embroidered through a wool support fabric are typically American. The term rugge or rugg appears in colonial inventories, where it refers to a woven yardage fabric used to make bedcovers. Such pieces were unique to the Connecticut River Valley. The information provided by the needlework contributes to the rarity of this piece: the initials H. J. refer to its maker, Hannah Johnson, the daughter of Ebenezer and Anna Johnson. It is dated 1796 and carries the number 26, which indicates that Johnson was twenty-six years old when she made it.",

This samovar, or Russian teakettle, beautifully illustrates the adroit mixture of taut lines and curvilinear motifs that characterizes Van de Velde’s mature Art Nouveau style. The sinuous organic lines of its base twist and snake around upright brackets and pick up again in the braided band motif of the teak handle. The kettle itself is simple in form, unornamented, and, with a prominent hinge on the spout cover, appears to be more engineered than crafted. This example was made from silvered brass and teak in accord with Van de Velde’s philosophy that art should be accessible and affordable to a broad public (though other examples were made of more costly silver). The kettle was designed at the Weimar School of Applied Arts, where Van de Velde became director in 1904. That school later became the Bauhaus, the bastion of modern design."

Blending Cartier-Bresson’s formal rigor with an explorative openness to new subject matter, Eggleston was soon working exclusively in color, producing rich, saturated dye-transfer prints. Although the 1975 exhibition of his work was met with skepticism, it declared to an entire generation of photographers that serious art could be made in color and with unassuming subjects drawn from the artist’s own experience. In this seemingly simple study, an abstracted American palette of red, white, and blue appears in a hanging jacket whose peaked hood carries more ominous connotations. Eggleston’s photographs are the necessary preamble to the work of such later talents as Richard Misrach and Nan Goldin.",

    "tale" : "Mark Bradford’s monumental abstract paintings comprise countless small fragments — often materials scavenged from storefronts, telephone poles, and billboards in the South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he grew up. The artist has explained, “I love the papered ‘mosaics’ I see in the community advertising the latest latest… . [When] the billboards are nice and thick and are about to fall off … I pull down what I need to create my collages… . Like those tagged up, repainted, tagged up, sanded, and repainted walls you pass everyday on the street, my process is both reductive and additive.” Bradford is also known for redeploying hair dye and wave endpapers from his mother’s salon, where he worked on and off for many years, and more recently for using home-repair caulking to amplify ridges and depths. It is usually impossible to recognize such individual materials on his surfaces; the power of Bradford’s work is the power of cumulative materiality, at once enigmatic and evocative. \nThe sweeping composition of A Siren beside a Ship is built up from a mix of carbon paper, caulking, and acrylic gel medium that Bradford relentlessly layered, sanded, and layered again to create a dense, suggestive texture. The surface’s striations recall rippling water and seascape paintings, which the artist has said summon for him the dark histories of conquistadors, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade. Given this work’s title, the wavelike markings also reference the dangerously enchanting voices of the Sirens of Greek mythology, as well as the sound of a modern-day alarm, combining a sense of allure with one of urgent warning.",

In this thangka, a painted cloth that can be rolled up for portability, Milarepa sits in a cave on Mount Kailash, which is sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus.

The dazzling snow-covered peaks frame each of the central figures, and below them multicolored foothills appear as prismatic spikes refracting the sun’s rays like jewels. Along the perimeter of the thangka, the five sisters of long life ride their mounts, accompanying Milarepa wherever he preaches his doctrine. The sacred peaks and lakes of the Himalayas have inspired numerous works of art—Milarepa, for example, wrote one hundred thousand songs about them. The other side of this textile contains a long inscription in Tibetan, demonstrating that this is one of the earliest representations of Milarepa.",

    "tale" : "This dramatic depiction of Christ’s suffering on his way to the Crucifixion is one of the first examples of drypoint by the anonymous master who invented this method of engraving. In drypoint the image is drawn directly on a metal plate with a sharp instrument, a process that preserves the artist’s personal “handwriting” and imparts to the print a characteristically velvety line. Here the printmaker skillfully exploited the soft, atmospheric effects, silvery shadows, and sense of delicate, luminous distances that are attainable in drypoint. The forest of lances that juts up behind the hills in the background also creates the illusion of depth. The central motif is Christ’s ordeal at the hands of three soldiers who force him and Simon of Cyrene, an innocent bystander, onward to the Mount of Calvary. On the left, the grieving figure of Mary, supported by the apostle John, is strikingly juxtaposed with the utterly indifferent soldier on the right, who has turned his back on the whole scene. This impression of The Road to Calvary is one of only three versions of this print. The Rijksprenten kabinet in Amsterdam owns eighty of the approximately ninety surviving prints by his hand.",

    "tale" : "Furuta Oribe (1544–1615) was a military general–turned–tea aesthete whose style of presentation at tea gatherings catered to the samurai class and rulers of seventeenth-century Japan. In contrast to his predecessors, Oribe preferred tea wares that were bold and eccentric rather than subtle and rustic. He was the first to recognize the beauty of artfully misshapen ceramics for use in tea gatherings. Ewers such as this were employed as water containers during the meal that preceded the tea service. Their distinctive glaze contains copper, which turned green in the firing process. This glaze, along with slightly off-kilter or distorted shapes, became trademarks of Oribe ware produced in the Mino region (now Gifu Prefecture) of Japan. \nThis vessel features drawings of plum blossoms, wheels, a hexagonal tortoiseshell pattern, and a lattice, all done in an underglaze iron wash. This is typical of such wares, which most often do not have a single decorative theme, but rather depict a mélange of almost abstract motifs akin to the popular patterning on textiles of the period.",

    "tale" : "Marcel Duchamp began his career as a painter of conventional portraits and nudes. By 1912, however, he set out to prove the end of “retinal art”—pictures created to delight the eye—in order to “put painting once again at the service of the mind.” His answer was the “readymade,” an ordinary object transformed into a work of art by virtue of the artist selecting it. Taken out of context, repositioned, and signed by the artist, the readymade upended tradition and artistic convention by revolutionizing the way we think about what an artwork is, how it is produced, and the ways in which it is exhibited. \nIn 1914 Duchamp purchased this mass-produced bottle rack at a department store. He felt free to acquire new versions for exhibitions and display after his sister accidentally discarded the “original.” He selected the present version for the 1959 exhibition Art and the Found Object in New York. Artist Robert Rauschenberg acquired Bottle Rack and asked Duchamp to sign it. He obliged, writing in French, “Impossible for me to recall the original phrase M.D. \/ Marcel Duchamp \/1960.”",

Here the right side of the bevor is fitted with a small door that could be opened by the wearer for additional ventilation between jousts.

    "tale" : "Julia Margaret Cameron began photographing at age forty-eight, after receiving a camera as a gift from her daughter and son-in-law. She soon became obsessed with photography, reveling in its messy magic and focusing more on the overall effects of her pictures than on technical perfection. Although she made portraits of some of the most important men of her day, Cameron’s female subjects helped her to explore the realm of mythology and imagination in highly allegorical and literary pictures. She delighted in dressing and posing friends, relatives, and servants as the Virgin Mary, Queen Esther, or Shakespeare’s faithful Cordelia. Julia Jackson, Cameron’s niece, was one of the few female sitters who posed for the photographer as herself. Known as a great beauty throughout her life, she was a favorite subject for Cameron, who took dozens of photographs of her over the course of ten years. In April 1867, shortly before Jackson’s wedding to her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, Cameron made a series of head-on portraits of the young bride-to-be that alternately reveal Jackson as noble, tender, and vulnerable. In this photograph, made after the wedding, Cameron captured Jackson’s mature beauty and extraordinary strength.",

    "tale" : "“The times are not the same for us old folk anymore,” reads a 1923 diary entry by Lovis Corinth, who suffered a stroke in 1911 and never quite recovered. “We have lost our way … so sad, so very sad.” The following year, the artist created this tortured self-image; he was sixty-five, with one year left to live. An inveterate self-portraitist, Corinth produced more images of himself than almost any other artist except Rembrandt van Rijn. In this haunting gouache, he gazes at the viewer in anguish. The brooding palette portrays a deeply shadowed face— contorted, haggard, and sunk into hunched shoulders. The pain that both the diary entry and this portrait convey is curiously at odds with Corinth’s professional life, which had, in fact, been successful. Challenging traditional approaches to art, his early figure compositions, with their overt sexuality and theatrical movements, made his reputation. Later he executed intensely colored, windswept landscapes that became his most popular works. But Corinth was a deeply patriotic man, and his personal accomplishments failed to assuage the torment he experienced after Germany’s humiliation in World War I and his despair over the values of the Weimar Republic that followed.",

    "tale" : "Born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, French architect Le Corbusier was one of the pillars of modern architecture. Concerned with the general principles of urban planning, his radical designs were intended to improve universal living conditions by addressing basic needs, attending to physical comfort, and promoting social discourse. Drafting was a vital, theoretical part of Le Corbusier’s process. To promote his ideas about modern building techniques and social reform, he published his drawings in books and in his journal, L’Esprit nouveau, disseminating his views to a wide audience. Le Corbusier was a crusader for new technologies and materials, such as reinforced concrete and pillar foundations. These resources liberated architectural design, allowing for the creation of vast, open floor plans with unobstructed window walls. Club de Centre Rural alludes to Le Corbusier’s rational yet humane vision of urban life. This perspective sketch, which displays Le Corbusier’s trademark economy of line, depicts a large, airy space in which clusters of people congregate. The building is constructed of plain walls and slender supporting pillars, divided and fronted by walls of pure glass.",

    "tale" : "A mesmerizing and sweeping composition of monochromatic ink on silk, Celestial Chaos No. 1 is among Tai Xiangzhou’s finest paintings. One of today’s leading Chinese artists, Tai is part of a generation that is working to reinvigorate tradition by embracing new ideas and techniques. Although fluent in styles of classical painting and calligraphy, he has in recent years developed an original approach that imbues traditional materials—brush, ink, paper, and silk—with a combination of highly expressive brushwork, abstraction, and monumental scale. \nThis painting embodies the basic ideas of Chinese cosmology, which views the world as a complete and complex organism in which the intrinsic nature of things is to move and change. Within this cyclical universe, humans are able to discern consistent patterns by observing the seasons and celestial realms, practicing dream divination, and manipulating the hexagrams of the I Ching. In this work, Tai captures that principle movement—atmospheric forces clashing and meteorites surging through mist and clouds—and organically merges the classical conception of the cosmos with his distinctively expressive style. The result is spontaneous, mysterious, but above all, beautiful. \nA scholar of art history and theory, Tai has asserted that “to present landscape painting that meets modern tastes, we must start from the experience of modern society—by properly accessing the living spirit of art, researching the materials, techniques, medium, and modern time-space experience. In short, we should not only keep alive traditional art, but also the tradition of art.”",

    "tale" : "Julia Fish’s methodical, meditative paintings are distillations of personal experiences, memories, and, above all, the artist’s immediate surroundings. Meticulously made and attentive to observed reality, her works nevertheless balance representation and abstraction, seeking an oscillation or equilibrium between the two. For the past two decades, Fish has worked in reference to the given materials, surfaces, and construction of her Chicago home and study—a former storefront dating to 1922—but another approach to \"found\" subjects took priority in the late 1980s. As the artist wrote in a statement in 1990, “With each painting I attempt to reconcile a singular response to an aspect of Nature… . Living within an urban setting, my work has grown to reflect the isolated framing of the natural world; and I find through developing each painting a parallel process of selection and reduction.” \nIn Bloom, an intimate and intense early work, Fish describes what might be read as vegetation in magenta, lavender, and deep green passages of paint that appear at once to hover above and recede into the pictorial plane. There is no evident light source, yet the painting as a whole seems to glow, as if backlit. More than a particular kind of bloom, this work captures the experience of seeing—or of straining to see—garden forms in twilight. Fish constructed a sense of fading, fluctuation, and ultimate visual instability through repeated horizontal and vertical brush marks. Progressive layers of point generated a lush, tactile surface that seems to behave organically rather than predictably.",

    "tale" : "Together with those of a riverscape, rocks, flowers, and branches of cedar and bamboo, the magpie is one of six images painted by Yao Shou along the length of this handscroll. Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as “bird-and-flower,” whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou’s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue. \nYao Shou accompanied the magpie—as he did its companion images—with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou: \nIn the bright moonlight, why does themagpie circle three times beforealighting?During sunny days, it sings on the greenbranches.I also practice divination to find the placewhere the magpie often roosts.It stays on the rooftop of the old master’shouse, and the stars arrive late. \nThe title and artist’s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. “Pillars of the Country” refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China’s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar —  all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past. \nAs documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95), China’s most passionate imperial collector.",

The result was his remarkable publication Paris at Night (first published in France in 1933), which depicts not only such well-known spots as the Arc de Triomphe, but also dark streets and alleys with just enough light to reveal a flower-shop window, a pissoir, a show at the Folies-Bergère, or the details of wet paving bricks. This image is from a 1932 series taken around Les Halles, in which Brassaï recorded women he called the “Venuses of the Crossroads,” or prostitutes standing at their posts. With an aura of mystery, Brassaï captured one of these ladies of the evening as she stood on the puddled street corner, smiling into the shadows.",

His evocative classical landscapes were sought after by papal patrons as well as by aristocrats and royalty throughout Europe. For nearly a century after his death, travelers on the grand tour of European capitals judged real scenery according to his standards. In Claude’s landscapes, as in this superb drawing, order and tranquility prevail; men perform no labor but rather exist peacefully in beautiful pastoral settings blessed by the warm Roman light. Depicted here is the region around the Sasso, a large rock ten miles south of Civitavecchia, Rome’s modern seaport. Evidently made at the site of the rock itself, the drawing is remarkable in its mastery of subtle ink washes that evocatively suggest, rather than describe, the landscape and sea.

    "title" : "The Long Road to Mazatlán",
    "tale" : "One of England’s most important independent filmmakers and a founder of the pioneering Sankofa Film and Video Collective (1983–92), Isaac Julien creates highly seductive films and video installations that explore the representation of race and masculinity in visual culture. Conflating conventional cinematic structure with avant-garde techniques, Julien subverts stereotypical portrayals of black and gay subjects, forcing viewers to question accepted representational archetypes. Produced collaboratively with Venezuela-born choreographer Javier De Frutos, The Long Road to Mazatlán is a modern cowboy story. Shot in and around San Antonio, Texas, the film captures the erotically charged interchanges between a young Hispanic man and the emotionally unavailable cowboy he pursues. Shot in lush color and layered imagery, the protagonists play out, as actors and at times as dancers, the subtle drama of the everyday, performing within carefully constructed environments. Through selected editing and the use of a three-screen installation, the artist composes a mise-en-scène that explores the social construction of masculinity within mythic landscapes of the American West.",

The cover helped preserve the frothy drink and also, using its three equidistant handles as legs, could be inverted into a stand for the cup. The vessel bears the mark CK, standing for Cornelius Kierstede, a third-generation New York silversmith of Dutch descent. Kierstede opened a shop around 1698 in New York, where he worked, off and on, until moving to New Haven, Connecticut, in the early 1720s. Like the Van Cortlandt family, who commissioned this cup and whose coat of arms it bears, and the Stuyvesant family, whose descendants owned the object until the Art Institute acquired it, the majority of Kierstede’s patrons were wealthy Dutch colonists. This cup is one of four nearly identical pieces made during the same period by Kierstede and two other well-known New York silversmiths. Evolved from English prototypes, all four have the same nearly straight sides, scroll-like handles, and slightly domed cover as well as variations of the embossed acanthus-leaf ornament."

Parted down the middle, his hair resembles an open book; finely incised parallel lines suggest that it has been meticulously combed, and a long double braid hangs down his back. His facial features are defined by raised eyebrows, high cheekbones, a tight mouth that curves slightly downward, and large pierced ears that project perpendicularly from his head. Evoking fierceness and shock, the man stares blankly ahead—like a subdued victim anticipating a terrifying, painful punishment. Figures with proportions and features similar to this sculpture have recently been unearthed at sites in southwestern Sichuan Province that date to the second millennium BC. Whereas those images were carved from more roughly textured stones and sometimes preserve traces of pigment, this example’s smooth, blackish-green surface appears unique. Scientific analyses indicate that the sculpture was probably darkened by burning before burial and, upon rediscovery, was polished and saturated with wax.",

These smaller boxes are mounted with gold and set with diamonds; each, when opened, reveals two types of porcelain gambling chips. The boxes were painted according to a complex, tightly organized decorative scheme. The lid of the large box depicts three trompe l’oeil playing cards that appear to have been carelessly thrown down. Each of the corners of the box and lid is painted with a network of violet and gold ornaments characteristic of the factory’s mature, late-Baroque style. With its liberal use of gold and diamonds, this work was certainly among the most extravagant objects crafted at the Du Paquier manufactory. The box may have been presented as a diplomatic gift, perhaps from the Austrian Habsburgs to their Russian Romanov counterparts.",

The next year, he returned home and worked at various Chicago firms until he founded his own practice in 1937. He is best known for Chicago’s Marina Towers, America’s first mixed-use urban-housing complex, which he completed in 1967. Two decades later, Goldberg made plans for the even more ambitious River City. Conceived as part of a huge marina along the south branch of the Chicago River, the development was to consist of a vast complex of linked towers housing thousands of residents. Believing that architecture should address the needs of the many, Goldberg envisioned River City as a self-sufficient environment that would foster a sense of community. Six clusters of seventy-two-story buildings, featuring the architect’s now trademark curvilinear concrete shell construction and cantilevered balconies, would wind a serpentine path along the river’s edge. Although the full scope of River City was never realized, a scaled-back version was built in 1987. Despite its diminished proportions, River City drew high praise and was hailed by the New York Times as “a remarkable space, unusually lyrical and soft in feeling for a structure finished in harsh concrete.”"

    "tale" : "William Pope.L is known for provocative, physically taxing performances as well as for text-based drawings and paintings. Many of the former have transpired unceremoniously in incidental public spaces such as parks, sidewalks, and gutters, with the artist donning variously symbolic attire — a skirt made of dollar bills and a sausage-link chain for ATM Piece (1997) and a capeless Superman costume for the ongoing Great White Way. Readily identifiable themes in Pope.L’s art include the disruption of conventions of cultural identity, the paradoxical idea of lack as a source of value, and the explosion of traditional artistic categories. He applies the term drawing liberally, for instance, stressing the impulses that make drawing necessary and the way in which tactile engagement with a given surface, form, or space can be considered an act of drawing. This work places a similar emphasis on the category of painting. \nThe title Finnish Painting proposes a strangely specific, yet also enigmatic, evocation of national identity and offers a play on words by referencing the imperative to “finish painting.” The surface is materially and formally riotous, comprised of the barely legible text of a poem whose last word is “decode”—as if acknowledging that to see, read, and understand others is always a struggle and that meaning is often fluid or open-ended. Meanwhile, the painting’s clearest feature is the signature-like name of artist Robert Ryman in the bottom right corner. Ryman, a figure associated with the emergence of Minimalism in the early 1960s, treated his signature as an important visual element within a painting’s composition, never simply as authorization of a finished canvas. Ryman is also known for a signature color (or noncolor): he makes white monochrome paintings, although sometimes the white has been layered on top of colorful, mostly or entirely obscured underpainting. Perhaps this Pope.L work reveals what might lie beneath Ryman’s white surfaces."

In 1912 Elmslie and his firm made additions to the house, including eight pieces of furniture. This elegant clock, whose works and nine chimes were imported from Germany, dates from this later commission. Its hands were executed by Chicago metalsmith Robert Riddle Jarvie according to Elmslie’s design. In his concern over creating an organic, harmonious relationship between the interior of a house and its exterior, the Scottish-born Elmslie found a staunch ally in designer George Niedecken, president of Niedecken-Walbridge, a firm based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which made the clock’s mahogany case.",

    "tale" : "Widely recognized as a pioneer of video art as installation, California-based artist Diana Thater is best known for work featuring images of animals such as bees, horses, and wolves. In Delphine, which takes as its primary subject wild dolphins interacting with humans, the artist worked for the very first time with untrained animals in their natural habitat. Complex spatial thinking is key to Thater’s projects; she understands installation art as a dialogue between sculpture and architecture. Projected on a large scale—onto entire ceilings, walls, and floors—her work thoroughly transforms the physical realities of the spaces it inhabits. This generic and spatial fluidity blurs conventional boundaries between the work and the viewer. The artist also insists on revealing how her images are made. Shot in both digital video and film, Delphine was edited without regard for separating the different media. Clarity and grain flow together as the immediacy and flatness of video gives way to the depth of film. These self-conscious production methods are mirrored by Thater’s particular aesthetic of presentation: she always leaves her equipment in full view inside the installation. This transparent approach, the artist insisted, “does not, as some people might have us believe, preclude transcendence. This is ultimately my point—that neither magic nor superficial beauty is required to approach the sublime.”",

During this period, caravans of merchants and Buddhist clerics traversed the vast network that modern scholars call the Silk Road, transporting China’s luxurious silks westward across Asia and returning with exotic goods from empires extending to the Mediterranean Sea. \nIn this textile’s jewel-like floral medallion, symmetrically curled and layered tendrils derived from the classical half palmette were adopted and refined by Chinese weavers from foreign sources. The stylized floral head seen from above, the blossoming stems in three-quarter view, and the half palmettes in profile merge naturalism and geometry by subtly varying perspective and color. This design pervaded East Asian decorative arts; similar floral medallions and scrolls embellish wall paintings, stone carvings, and vessels of ceramic and silver that Tang aristocrats commissioned for their tombs, Buddhist temples, and private treasuries. Architectural tiles from palace sites in Korea and, most notably, exquisite silk fabrics and carpets preserved in the Shosoin repository in Nara, Japan, attest to the transmission of these patterns throughout East Asia in the eighth century.",

Characterized by its white body fabric, brilliant transparent glaze, and distinct decoration, Iznik pottery represents one of the most technologically refined and aesthetically arresting traditions in the history of Islamic ceramics. Here the decoration consists of a motif of hyacinths and carnations, underscored with blue tulips and red roses. The artist fully realized the rhythmic potential of alternating floral forms, exploiting the tankard’s tall, cylindrical surface to create a feeling of motion. Though the Iznik tradition seems to have been intially inspired by imported Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, by the 1550s, Iznik pottery had been transformed. Working in collaboration with the imperial Ottoman atelier in Istanbul (nakkash-hane), Iznik potters helped to create a style that epitomized an empire and was eventually sought after far from Istanbul. The tulip and carnation motif was particularly popular and appears on book bindings, paper borders, and textiles made for the Ottoman court. The craze for tulips was not limited to ornament, however. The real flowers were cultivated in Istanbul’s gardens, and the bulbs were exported to Europe. The size of this tankard even suggests that it may have once been used as a flower vase, perhaps to hold the very blossoms it depicts.",

    "tale" : "This tall-case clock represents a masterful collaboration between two major figures in the Vienna Secession movement: the architect Josef Hoffmann and the designer Carl Otto Czeschka. Like their English counterparts in the Arts and Crafts movement, the Secessionists initially supported the credo that art is for everyone and worked to create beautiful, simple objects for everyday use. A manifestation of this philosophy was the Wiener Werkstätte, or Vienna Workshop, of which Hoffmann was a founder and Czeschka a member. Produced by the Werkstätte’s specialist craftsmen, this clock embodies the unexpected dichotomy that arose within the workshop: its early reformist ideals resulted in progressive, even avant-garde, products that appealed primarily to a privileged, sophisticated clientele. Hoffmann’s design consists of simple, architectonic forms emphasized through the bold use of stark white-painted maple and an inlaid checkered pattern. In contrast to the case’s austere rectilinearity, Czeschka designed a luxurious, hand-wrought scheme for its dial and door. The door is fashioned from hand-embossed gilt brass inset with cut-glass prisms. Its richly patterned surface decoration depicts a stylized tree of life motif.",

    "tale" : "A painter, architect, and designer as well as a photographer, El Lissitzky believed that avant-garde art could transform daily life. One of the key figures to integrate artistic developments in Russia with those in Western Europe, he began experimenting with photography seriously in Germany in 1923. Lissitzky was fascinated by the possibilities of photograms, multiple exposures, and what he called fotopis—loosely translatable as “photo-writing”—and he eventually abandoned painting to focus on combined photographic and architectural projects. \nPhotograms (images made by placing objects directly on photographic paper and exposing them to light, rather than with a camera) were taken up in Dada and Constructivist circles in different countries between 1919 and 1923. The primitive technology, which dispensed with lenses, permitted a merger of touch and sight that Lissitzky thematized in this picture by having himself (at left) and fellow painter and designer Vilmos Huszár appear to be the twinned pupil of a ghostly eyeball—at once pictured and the embodied agent of picturing. \nThis photogram incorporates circular images of El Lissitzky (with pipe) and another artist, Vilmos Huszár. It is printed on gelatin silver paper, the standard black-and-white pho-tographic paper of the 20th century. The absence of an intermediary baryta layer (a distinctive preparatory layer containing white pigment typically present in a gelatin silver print) gives it a very matte surface, while the gray tonality is most likely due to underdevelopment.",

    "tale" : "A product of the Arts and Crafts movement in England, the Manxman Pianoforte represents an innovative solution to the somewhat awkward form of the upright piano. Motivated by the shoddy results of industrial mass production, the movement advocated the recognition of furniture and decorative arts as works of art. Here the celebrated English architect and designer Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott created an object that is both cleverly functional and aesthetically pleasing. When opened, the lid and doors of the strikingly decorated cabinet act as acoustical sounding boards. Revealed inside is the musical instrument itself, along with a profusion of exquisite handcrafted metalwork, including candleholders fixed to the sides of the case. The overall design, like the keyboard, is a study in contrasts of light and dark; the lower section’s alternating pattern echoes the piano’s keys. A Manxman is an inhabitant of the Isle of Man, and the term derives from Scott’s early residence there. This piano is one of a number executed around 1900 with John Broadwood and Sons of London, who made the musical movements.",

Prior to 1903 he was an influential member of the Moderne Movement in Vienna. Moser was also a founder of the Vienna Secession, the association of young artists who had broken away from the Wiener Künstlerhaus, the accepted artistic forum of the time. Poppyheads, designed by Moser three years before the Wiener Werkstätte was formed, foreshadowed the kind of elegant textile designs he would produce at the Werkstätte. The attenuated lines coupled with the simplification and abstraction of organic forms demonstrate a new aesthetic vision of the time shared by artists and designers in Vienna and Glasgow. Moser’s design was produced in various colors by the Viennese firm of Johann Backhausen und Söhne, which was closely linked to the Werkstätte and is still in business today. The textile was intended for upholstery or curtain fabric, ideally for rooms whose design and furnishings would be produced as total environments by Werkstätte artists.",

    "tale" : "Wanda Pimentel emerged as an important young artist within Brazil’s 1960s New Figuration movement. This was a Pop Art–inflected turn to representational painting as a form of sardonic commentary on and resistance to a number of forces—a dictatorial government, the rise of consumer culture in parallel with a rise in urban poverty, and, in Pimentel’s case specifically, the stereotypes and constraints imposed on women by a patriarchal society. \nPimentel began her decade-long Involvement Series around 1965; as she put it a few years later, “My studio is in my bedroom. Everything has to be very neat… . I work alone. I think my issues are the issues of our time: the lack of perspective for people, their alienation. The saddest thing is for people to be dominated by things.” Rendered in a vivid but reduced palette and a flat, graphic style, these early works hint at intimate, mundane scenes. They depict domestic objects in enigmatic, compressed interiors and suggest acts of corresponding domestic labor, always implying—if not always representing—a woman’s body. When pictured, this body is fragmented—a leg or a pair of feet rather than a fully legible form. In this 1968 canvas, for example, a pair of feet peek out from below the horizon-like line of a red ironing board. The owner of these feet is otherwise only indicated by a rack of blouses and by the ready iron: the trappings of stereotyped female labor and identity.",

In their partnership (formed in 1911 at the time of their marriage), Walter Burley Griffin was chief designer, while Marion Mahony, one of the nation’s first women to distinguish herself in architecture, contributed to design and produced the spectacular renderings for which the firm was noted. In this exquisite work, she delineated the pair’s major domestic work and the most important planning scheme of the Prairie School: the Iowa housing development Rock Crest–Rock Glen (begun in 1912). The vaguely Japanesque intertwining of single-family dwellings within the eighteen-acre site is a perfect encapsulation of the Prairie School’s emphasis on the harmonious integration of suburban domesticity and a tamed, almost pastoral, nature. Of the sixteen proposed houses, eight were built, four by the Griffins. Just as construction began, the couple won the international competition to plan Canberra, the new capital of Australia; the commission allowed them to bring their aesthetic to an international audience.",

    "tale" : "Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",

Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created primarily through costume, hair, makeup, and lighting. In 1981 she began a series of large color photographs that mimic the horizontal format of a magazine centerfold. Critiques of these glossy spreads, Sherman’s representations are fraught with anxiety, vulnerability, and longing. In Untitled #88, she depicted herself as a young, disheveled blonde girl; her fragility and isolation are underscored by her huddled body language and pensive stare. An imposing darkness surrounds her, except for the warm glow from what is most likely a fire, the only source of light in the picture. While the girl’s specific situation remains ambiguous, the photograph illustrates that, for Sherman, gender roles are performative.",

A blossoming plum tree embroidered with gold and white silk thread spreads its branches from hem to shoulder. The carefully embroidered blooming tree shows the influence of Western art on Japanese design. Needlework typical of this period was used to portray illusionistically the contours of the tree trunk.

Here Tawney, known for her pioneering exposure of the warp (vertical thread element), provided a variant on that theme: she wove the circle with slits that open at regular half-inch intervals, emphasizing a third dimension, a device she utilized in many of her weavings. Trained in sculpture at the Institute of Design in Chicago and an alumna of the School of the Art Institute, Tawney’s exploration of weaving as a sculptural enterprise fits well within her body of work, which also includes laminated boxes and collages as well as constructions composed of such materials as eggshells and chairs.",

With this increased demand, talented sign painters such as Ammi Phillips saw new opportunities. Phillips taught himself to be a limner—a painter of portraits. By 1811 he had learned painting techniques from other Connecticut limners, who executed full-length, three-quarter, and bust portraits on canvas, wood, and glass. Phillips began to use conventional poses adopted from European prints and became one of the most successful portraitists of the middle and upper classes in rural New England, plying his trade in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. \nHere Phillips depicted Dr. Cornelius Allerton seated in a painted chair against a somber, gray background. Although the sitter’s face is relatively unmodeled, the artist’s careful rendering of detail captures a sense of his individuality. The inclusion of a volume of Parr’s Medical Dictionary conveys Allerton’s profession, while a tiny horse in the distance may suggest his financial status. Itinerant painters such as Phillips were often commissioned to portray several members of a family; in this case, Phillips also completed portraits of Allerton’s mother (1946.395) and mother-in-law (Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford). This painting was given to the Art Institute by Robert Allerton, the sitter’s grandson and an important benefactor of the museum."

    "tale" : "Marking the height of the “modern Gothic” style in Philadelphia, this sideboard resembles the furniture designed by notable architect Frank Furness, who frequently collaborated with cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst. Although details of the piece’s carving tie it unmistakably to Pabst, the design cannot be attributed conclusively to a particular hand. The designer was influenced by the writings of Christopher Dresser and Charles Eastlake, British reformers who advocated honesty of construction and conventionalized ornament. Instead of carving the decoration deeply in order to achieve a naturalistic effect, Pabst used a cameo technique, cutting through the burled elm veneer to reveal the darker walnut beneath and creating a striking color contrast and flattened style of decoration. \nIn the mid-nineteenth century, dining-room furniture typically featured ornament that was intended to reinforce ideals of hospitality and gentility. Here the cabinet doors display designs recounting Aesop’s fable of the fox and the stork, a tale in which each animal offers the other some food in a serving dish from which the guest cannot eat, thus proving the importance of true hospitality. The panels are virtually identical to images found on curtain designs illustrated in Eastlake’s 1868 book Hints on Household Taste, a text that was widely influential in the United States.",

A sock, a postcard, and an army-flare parachute are among the used and discarded remnants of everyday life held in balance by the expressive brush-strokes and spatters of paint. Echoing this application, the strings of the parachute drip like paint from the canvas, forming a catenary, the curve imposed by the force of gravity on a string suspended freely from two points. With this rupture of the picture plane, the fictive space of the artwork’s surface engages the actual space occupied by the viewer.",

Jacobs House, he began a series of curved designs that were specifically constructed for the particular topographical character of a site in order to take advantage of solar energy. Wright had designed the Jacobs family’s former residence near Madison, Wisconsin; however, they wished to escape congestion and thus enlisted him to design a second home further out in the country. In this perspective view, Wright emphasized the home’s innovative features by depicting it at midday. Direct sunlight casts a bold swath of inky black shadow that dramatizes the interior curve of the building’s semicircular design. The south facade bends around a circular sunken garden. Large windows and glass doors welcome the weak winter sun while the wide, overhanging roof shields against summer’s direct rays. To protect from strong winds and to insulate the home, the house was set into a berm. The thick masonry walls that flank the facade link the building to its natural setting while offering a textural contrast to the glass front and airy interior."

    "tale" : "Contained within this haunting and poetic image is the seed of photography: the possibility of creating a negative from which an unlimited number of positives can be made. William Henry Fox Talbot produced this image by placing botanical specimens on sensitized paper and exposing them to light. He made this groundbreaking discovery after his 1833 honeymoon on the shores of Lake Como, in Lombardy, Italy. Frustrated by his inability to draw his Italian surroundings accurately, Talbot recalled the fleeting images of external objects that appeared within a camera lucida (an optical prism that creates a superimposed image on an artist’s drawing surface) and wondered how he could make them “imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed upon the paper.” What resulted, two years later, were the first camera negatives. Unveiled in 1839 and called photogenic drawing, Talbot’s process was perfected two years later into the calotype (from the Greek word kalos, meaning “beautiful”). By the end of his life, Talbot—whose far-ranging interests included mathematics, botany, etymology, and ancient Assyria—had also discovered the basis of halftone printing, obtained twelve patents, and authored seven books, including one of the first photographically illustrated books, The Pencil of Nature (1844)."

Among the finest ecclesiastical vestments is this resplendent velvet cope, a semicircular cloak worn as an outer garment in processions or during special ceremonies by a priest or bishop. The elegant needlework was called opus anglicanum (English work). Surrounding the cope’s central image of the Assumption of the Virgin, rendered in silk and gold threads, are seraphim standing on wheels, thistles, fleurs-de-lis, and double-headed eagles—all connected by tendrils animated by spangles. Old Testament prophets and New Testament saints with their attributes alternate on the orphrey band, which runs the full width of the work. Saint Paul is depicted on the hood, which rests on the back of the cope, while an image of God holding an orb decorates the morse, or closure. The brown-velvet ground is an unusual color for vestments of this style; it may have faded from purple or crimson.",

    "tale" : "The Goryeo dynasty was a golden age for Korean ceramic making, and outstanding among the era’s wares are understatedly elegant celadons. Celadon is an iron-based glaze capable of an almost infinite range of colors, depending on the amount of oxygen in the kiln. Although Korean potters initially drew on Chinese models for both vessel shapes and celadon techniques, this maebyeong (plum vase)—with its shallow cuplike lid, swollen shoulders, and constricted waist—is thoroughly Korean. The cool beauty of the vase’s greenish blue glaze represents such perfection of the technique that even the Chinese admired Korean celadons as surpassing their own. A unique Korean contribution to ceramic development is the inlay of delicately rendered designs. In this precise and time-consuming process, designs carved or incised on the body of the vessel were filled in with black or white clay prior to glazing and firing. Here the appealing and often playful designs are auspicious Korean symbols: the motif of cranes flying through drifting clouds, which separates the three double-trefoil frames, symbolizes longevity; the plump children, who chase a butterfly, signify happiness, prosperity, and abundant progeny; and the tiny duck is associated with marital fidelity.",

    "tale" : "Andrew Jackson was described by a contemporary as having “an erect military bearing, and a head set with considerable fierté [pride] upon his shoulders… . His eye is of a dangerous fixedness; … [and] the instant his lips close, a visor of steel would scarcely look more impenetrable.” William Rush rendered a remarkably similar depiction of the general. Demonstrating a blend of naturalism, subtlety, and strength, Rush avoided grandiosity in this terra-cotta portrait bust of the fifty-two-year-old military hero, who, ten years later, would begin to serve the first of two consecutive terms as president of the United States. The artist’s only concession to idealization was the replacement of the general’s well-known stiff, wiry hair with the soft curls that signify noble qualities in Neoclassical sculpture. Since there is no documentation that Jackson formally posed for Rush, the artist, a prominent resident of Philadelphia, may have observed the general during his three-day visit to the city in 1819. This sculpture achieved critical and commercial success, with one reviewer ranking it as “Rush’s masterpiece.” Hoping to benefit from Jackson’s popularity, Rush followed the European custom of producing plaster replicas of the bust.",

    "tale" : "Perhaps the last great name connected with the French silk industry in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is that of Jean-Démosthène Dugourc. A designer of costumes and stage decorations for the French opera, he was also the superintendent of buildings and designer of Garde-Meuble for the Duc d’Orléans. Dugourc was the most outstanding interior decorator of his time, and from 1774 to 1790 he produced designs for the silk manufacturer Camille Pernon of Lyon. Educated in Italy for a time, Dugourc was familiar with the classical antique motifs that Raphael had revived in his fresco decorations for the Vatican Loggie, part of the papal palace in Rome. In fact, the French designer titled a group of textile patterns Verdures of the Vatican. The Pheasants, which was designed for the Spanish royal palace in Madrid, is part of this series. The elaborate composition encompasses a lavish, symmetrical interplay of birds, baskets, strings of pearls, garlands, and ribbons—all realized with the excellence of workmanship that made French silks so desirable.",

Cows enjoy a respected status in India: they are regarded as the nourishing mother, as portrayed in this frieze, and even their waste is used in purification rituals and for fuel. \nIn the medieval period in India, the cow came to be particularly associated with Krishna, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, who grew up in Vrindavan (near Mathura) among cowherds, a theme much celebrated in art. Less common are individual portrayals of a cow and calf, like this relief, which most likely came from the walls of a Hindu temple, possibly from central India, and can be dated to around the ninth century. It is possible that this relief was once part of a larger narrative scene on a temple wall, perhaps depicting Krishna among cows and cowherds.",

This elderly vagabond from the Savoy region of France was one of many peasants who, around the turn of the eighteenth century, flocked to Paris, where they tried to eke out livings as chimney sweeps, scavengers, or street entertainers. This old entertainer’s props accompany him: a large box of curiosities is on his back, and under his arm is a smaller case probably containing his constant companion and coperformer, a furry marmot. Using only two colors of chalk, Watteau depicted the Savoyard’s shrewd, humorous face, his tattered clothing, and his bulky paraphernalia with remarkable precision, sensitivity, and humanity. Of the ten extant studies of Savoyards by Watteau, four appear to portray the same salty character seen here. The drawing’s broad, free execution points to the accomplished late works of this gifted artist."

    "tale" : "In 1923 Edward Weston embarked on a new life in Mexico, leaving California behind him. He set up a portrait studio with his muse and apprentice, Tina Modotti, who introduced him to such artists as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. Stimulated by the vital Mexican culture—as well as by his previous contacts with the great photographers Charles Sheeler, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand—Weston’s soft-focus, painterly style underwent a radical change. “The camera must be used for a recording of life,” he wrote during this period, “for rendering the very substance and quintessence of the thing itself.” This simple metal washbowl, which he stored under his sink, is an example of the new and unconventional subjects Weston began to photograph during his Mexican sojourn. In his obsession with clarity of form and precision of image, he pioneered a technique that he called “previsualizing”—looking at a scene through the camera and determining how that would translate to a print; any cropping, trimming, or enlarging of the print was rejected as a betrayal of vision. Here he captured the worn metal and porcelain surfaces of the washbowl and sink with sensuous, almost preternatural clarity. An important transitional piece, this work prefigures Weston’s exquisite and erotic studies of nudes, shells, and plant forms.",

    "tale" : "“What is true of the oil or watercolor is equally true of the photograph,” Edward Steichen once said, aptly expressing the overt pictorial intent of Rodin, Le Penseur. This romantic silhouette portrait depicts Auguste Rodin seated in his studio opposite his famous work Le Penseur, with his sculpture of Victor Hugo in the background. In 1902, the year he made this photograph, Steichen believed he would become a painter, and he visited Rodin and his circle of artists and admirers often. But as a founding member of Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession group, Steichen increasingly created photographs that were the artistic equivalents of his paintings, in the hope of winning artistic credibility for the newer art form. Here the artist expertly manipulated the elastic and expressive gum-bichromate method, in which the application of water and brushwork in the printing process can soften or omit details, reduce dark spaces, and even change light into dark (and vice versa). The result is a combination of two separate images, both dramatically posed and lit, into a striking, painterly photograph. \nFor more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: Edward Steichen’s World War I Years. \nFor more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",

    "tale" : "The inventive lyre shape of this secretary, surmounted by three stepped drawers and supported by griffins, identifies it as an elaborate, complex case form made in Vienna during the Napoleonic era. The upper half of the front falls forward to serve as a writing surface revealing interior compartments, drawers, and shelves. The secretary shares characteristics with the Empire style developed in France, a bolder and more severe expression of the Neoclassical interest in ancient Greek and Roman art. Though craftsmen throughout Europe studied French handbooks detailing new designs, models were not merely imitated; this example was made with materials and techniques typical of Viennese workshops. Its form has no direct source in antiquity, although the lyre shape and abundant decorative details—griffins, cornucopias, paw feet, and interior caryatid figures—are familiar classical motifs. The variety of woods, selected to create contrast between light areas and dark borders, matches the pastiche of decorative forms. Vienna was a major European design center in the early nineteenth century, and this desk type enjoyed wide popularity. Production continued throughout the ensuing Biedermeier era, into the 1840s.",

    "tale" : "This woman’s robe exemplifies the long tradition of ikat production in Central Asia, specifically, in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, once an active center along the ancient Silk Road. Among the many uses of ikats was their role as a component of a woman’s dowry. A woman would have worn this robe at weddings and other special occasions, and at her funeral it would have been draped over her bier. The choice of fabric was determined by a woman’s age and status. In general, young women wore bright colors and large patterns, while older women dressed in more sober hues. Most women wore garments made of inexpensive native cotton fabrics, but wealthy women owned robes made of silk and cotton-wefted ikat fabric. Ikat is an ancient technique involving precise and repeated tying (binding) and dyeing of threads or yarns before they are woven. The warp threads are dyed, while the weft threads usually remain solid in color. These threads intersect at right angles during the weaving process; the results are complex patterns in dazzling color combinations that produce a slightly blurred visual effect known by the Persian word abr (“cloud”).",

Exhibiting Surrealist-inspired work aimed at subverting artistic conventions and standards of taste, these artists became part of the Chicago Imagist movement. Although each member developed a distinct style, collectively they shared an emphasis on intuition and spontaneity and an affection for wordplay and humor. In his earliest paintings, Nutt referenced popular culture, particularly painted store windows and pinball machines, through his choice of medium and support—acrylic paint on Plexiglas. In addition, many elements of his early style relate to the comic strip: hard, crisp forms stand out boldly against simple backgrounds. In Miss E. Knows he also appropriated a sequential format, incorporating small, framed images in the upper-left corner of the painting. The work depicts a grotesquely imagined, highly sexualized female figure—Nutt’s satire of ideal beauty. The artist included the cartoonish light beam across her eyes as a reference to the cinema. By attaching objects such as rubber tubing and a coat hook to its surface, Nutt heightened the Surrealist effect of this image.",

    "tale" : "In 1955 the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank rented a secondhand car and, for the next two years, traveled with his 35mm Leica camera throughout the United States, capturing his impressions with the ironic distance of an outsider. Made possible by a Guggenheim Foundation grant (the first awarded to a foreigner), this photographic odyssey resulted in a landmark book, Les Américains, published in France in 1958. The brilliant technical “wrongness” of Frank’s gritty, rough, and graceless images represented a new and highly influential expressionistic approach to photographic observation. Meant to be viewed as a series, Frank’s photographs are filled with such Americana as luncheonettes and jukeboxes, tailfins and motels, and the American flag. Dominating this depiction of the nation’s annual birthday party, which Frank made before embarking on his trip around the United States, the star-spangled banner hardly waves bravely or freely. Instead it hangs down over a Fourth of July picnic, sheer and patched, like the bars of a prison. As the Beat writer Jack Kerouac noted in his introduction to the controversial 1959 American edition of Frank’s book: “With that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film.” Frank subsequently turned to filmmaking and returned to still photography upon his move to Nova Scotia in 1969."

    "tale" : "This exquisite Mughal mirror frame of pale-green nephrite jade is inlaid with gems in the kundan technique, a quintessentially Indian method of gem setting. The motif of this luxury item designed for the Mughal court is a tree of life with inlaid gold stems and leaves and buds of rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. Above the naturalistically depicted plant are two abstracted Chinese-style clouds in gold. Acanthus-leaf motifs adorn the top and bottom of the frame, while the mirror handle is in the shape of an unopened flower bud. \nJade was imported into India from the Khotan region of China. The owner of the jade concession there, the merchant Khwaja Mu’in, visited the court of Mughal emperor Akbar in 1563 and presented him with jade pieces. The earliest Mughal jades reflect Timurid, Ottoman, Safavid, and Chinese influences, and the finest jade objects were produced during the Jahangir and Shah Jahan periods in the seventeenth century. Jade was used for eating and drinking vessels, jewelry, sword hilts and scabbards, belt buckles, mirrors, and hookah parts. Inlaying jade with gold and setting it with gems was a popular Mughal technique derived from earlier Timurid traditions in Iran and Central Asia. This frame is a fine example of the union of various cultural motifs in a single object—a hallmark of Mughal art.",

Beginning in the ninth century, the worship of luohan and their depiction in art evolved primarily in the context of the Chan (Zen), or “meditation,” sect of Buddhism. This head was created in the delicate technique of hollow dry lacquer. The artisan first soaked layers of coarse cloth in lacquer (a thick sap tapped from a sumac tree) and applied these to a clay core formed over an armature of wood or other material. After allowing the work to dry, he applied a thick layer of lacquer paste to create the basic shape of the sculpture and a thinner coat into which he carefully modeled the eyes, high cheekbones, and other facial features. After removing the core and supporting armature, he set colored beads behind the eyes to represent irises and pupils. Finally, he painted the surface and perhaps applied gilding. Although these surface finishes have disintegrated over the centuries, the sensitively executed facial features preserve the insightful expression of the luohan.",

    "tale" : "In the early 1960s, as a young student in New York, Jack Whitten established ties with an older generation of black artists that included Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, as well as with leading Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, Ad Reinhardt, and Franz Kline. During the second half of the decade, Whitten began working toward an entirely unique relationship to painting that he described in this way: “About 1965 I wrote on my studio wall one day, the image is photographic; I must photograph my thoughts.” By 1970 the artist had eliminated both expressive color and figuration from his work, launching a ten-year series of paintings that capture, like a camera, the often chance-based immediacies of his dynamic studio process. \nKhee II exhibits all the hallmarks of Whitten’s mature process-derived paintings. As with other works from this period, the artist placed a variety of flat, shaped objects beneath the canvas. After preparing the surface with gesso, he layered it with thin sheets of colored Japanese rice paper. The rice paper dissolved, leaving behind pure pigment. Whitten then pulled a rake or other notched tool—which he calls a “developer,” in obvious reference to a photographer’s chemicals—across the work’s surface. This served both to impress the shapes from below, effectively embossing the canvas, and to disperse color on top of it. The result is a series of ghostlike images and alternating rows of color that vibrate with subtle luminosity. This is a glowing evocative abstract painting that is also a layer-by-layer document of its own making.",

When a deity appears at the center of a mandala, it serves as a reminder to the devotee of the god’s presence in the cosmos, as well as to the fact that the god is the cosmos. Here the concept is expressed by a mandala of three concentric outer circles rising to the space of the square. \nIdentifiable by the pot of life-giving water in her lower-left hand and the gesture of boon granting (varadamudra) of her lower-right hand, Vasudhara also has traits that distinguish her as Nepalese: her six encircling arms and the graceful lalitasana pose, with one leg pendent and the other tucked beneath her. (In India and Tibet, she is often shown standing and with two arms.) The goddess’s complexion is depicted as golden in sculpture and yellow in painting, a symbol of her wealth-giving attributes. Vasudhara is especially popular with the Buddhist Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, who would probably have used an object such as this for rituals dedicated to the goddess in either a temple or the home.",

She worked with such artists as Fernand Léger and quickly began to incorporate abstraction into her work.

The artist’s rapid, virtuoso draftsmanship evokes forms with what seems like a minimum of effort, and his powerful handling of brush and wash reflects his ability to capture the effects of light. The interplay between the drawing’s broad, free underdrawing and its shimmering veils of wash lend this work its charm and vivacity.

Like an epic poem, the series is divided into cantos, now numbering twenty-eight. Canto III, “The Flood,” focuses on the Salton Sea, a lake that was created by an engineering mistake at the beginning of the twentieth century. The lake was stocked with fish in the 1950s to promote tourism but became permanently flooded a few decades later, leaving odd and often ironic reminders of human folly poking out of the water; the fish (seen at the bottom right of the picture) experience summer die-off due to the warming of the salty water and choking algae blooms. With biblical overtones of the apocalypse, Misrach here expanded the landscape tradition from a depiction of the picturesque to an expression of political engagement.",

Ruins of their spectacular cliff dwellings and multistory towns of sandstone masonry are widely scattered in northern New Mexico, Arizona, and southern parts of Utah and Colorado. Skilled farmers, the Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) were also creative artisans, as seen in this large, striking olla, a storage vessel. Dramatically decorated in the black-on-white ground of the Black Mesa style, the vessel displays a continuous swirling band of barbed, interlocking S shapes. This strong rhythmic pattern is best perceived from above, suggesting that the olla’s usual placement was on the floor. Like most ollas, this vessel originally had a taller neck, which broke off and was ground down by its owner. In Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) tradition, as among the Pueblos today, ceramic vessels were primarily made by women. The potter’s wheel was unknown, and skilled artisans created the evenly thin walls of their vessels by the coiling method. In this technique, the pot is built up with successive coils of clay that are then patted and thinned to achieve the final globular shape. Designs are painted using liquefied clay slips with mineral colors before firing the vessel in an open environment instead of a kiln.",

It recounts details from the life of Ryōnin (1073–1132), a charismatic Tendai monk who founded the Yuzū sect. The Buddhist concept of yuzū refers to the interrelationship or initial oneness of all things. The dynamically new approach to salvation that Ryoōnin developed from yuzū reasoned that if all things are interrelated, the meritorious action of one individual benefits many. Followers of Amidism registered their names in a tally book, pledging to recite the brief nembutsu prayer, an invocation of the Amida Buddha, at specific times during the day. Contrasted with the dense and elite ritual of Buddhist teachings of the Heian period (794–1185), this simple, more populist approach to Buddhism had enormous appeal. Commissioned and executed in the mid-fourteenth century, during the revival of the Yuzū sect, this lengthy horizontal scroll is unrolled from right to left and intended to be studied in successive sections each approximately the width of the viewer’s shoulders.",

In Sufism, such numerological devices are held to be a powerful reflection of divine mystery. Like words, they are filled with sacred blessings, or Baraka. The elongated quadruped figure may represent a lizard, a spirit, or a stylized rendering of the name Muhammad. Attached amulets further punctuate the textile. These commonly encase small squares of folded paper bearing sacred writing. Across Senegal, learned Sufi practitioners applied their esoteric knowledge of sacred writing to the therapeutic practices of divination, healing, and spiritual protection.

As the field has matured, Hernan Díaz Alonso, principal architect of the Los Angeles firm Xefirotarch, has emerged as a significant figure; his studio’s grotesque, animal-like forms exemplify just how far digital practice has evolved. Shown here is the model for Sur, the firm’s winning entry for the Museum of Modern Art\/P.S.1 Young Architects Program. The piece is composed of an acrylic surface that supports three-dimensional forms printed from nylon composite. The actual pavilion was constructed of bent aluminum tubing clad with reflective fabric sheathing and fiberglass benches and platforms painted Ferrari red. The title Sur, taken from a popular Argentine tango, refers to the rhythmic forms of the work. While Díaz Alonso draws freely from a wide range of visual-arts disciplines—especially film and video—he combines these influences with digital manipulation and distortion to explore the limits of beauty and scale. His constructions reintroduce an experimental notion of figuration to the pedagogy and practice of digital architecture.",

    "tale" : "When Edvard Munch was thirteen years old, his sister Sophie died of tuberculosis. Nine years later, he created the first of five painted versions of The Sick Child, all representing Sophie just prior to her death. Munch later described the process of painting these works as a form of technical and personal catharsis. \nDue to the great success of the paintings and his own psychological preoccupations, in 1894–96 Munch made three prints based on the motif, of which The Sick Child I was the last. In 1896 the artist traveled to Paris to experiment with new print-making processes and work with respected printers such as Auguste Clot, hoping to gain the commercial success that had previously eluded him in the French capital. There he made this, his first color lithograph, which features Sophie’s head silhouetted against a pillow. Munch printed the lithograph with several different stones and a variety of color combinations: he made the keystone either black or red and added up to four other color stones in combinations of blue, gray, red, yellow, reddish brown, and purple-blue. Munch was keenly aware of the symbolic associations of various colors, and the icy blue and stark black of this impression suggest the haunting pallor of death.",

The Emperor Sailing shows the elder emperor seated in a ceremonial dragon boat as it pulls away from a quay. Members of the imperial family and their attendants watch the launch from underneath an arcade, in close proximity to a crane and a tortoise that together symbolize their well-wishes for the monarch. Philippe Behagle, then director of the Beauvais tapestry workshop, commissioned the design of this tapestry suite in the mid-1680s to cater to the French court’s increasing fascinating with China. As an allegory of good governance, the series makes manifest the parallels, first propounded by French Jesuit missionaries in China, between Louis XIV and Kangxi.",

Sharaku’s prints are frank and piercing, combining satire with decorative power. His aggressive style is made all the more dramatic by his use of a dark mica background, which throws the silhouette of the posturing actor into strong relief. Depicted here is the actor Bandō Mitsugorō portraying the character Ishii Genzō at the peak dramatic moment of the play The Iris Sōga of the Bunroku Era (Hanaayame Bunroku Sōga). With a look of intense fury, Genzō draws his sword to aid his two brothers-in-law in avenging their father’s murder. The play is based on an event that occurred in 1701 that disrupted the civil order of the Tokugawa shogunate and scandalized the population of Edo. Commentary on contemporary issues was discouraged by the Japanese government, however, so the play was disguised as a literary recounting of a famous twelfth-century act of filial revenge that occurred in the Sōga family. Unlike the elite and highly stylized Noh theater, Kabuki was a popular form of drama that reflected and catered to the tastes and pleasures of the emerging merchant class.",

    "tale" : "This extraordinary sculptural group, which consists of a male nude astride a rearing horse, is a rare example of the work of Hans Ludwig Kienle, a German silversmith who specialized in depicting animals. Conceived as a drinking cup, this work was destined for display on a buffet or sideboard. Kienle’s work belongs to a larger body of German Renaissance and Baroque sideboard silver that includes cups in the form of three-dimensional horses, lions, stags, and other animals. Horse-and-rider figural groups have their roots in earlier Greek and Roman sculpture. Renaissance princes often had themselves depicted in monumental form, wearing Classical dress or contemporary armor and sitting atop prancing or rearing steeds. That Kienle based this silver cup on an earlier sculptural model is suggested by the existence of a bronze group of virtually identical subject, composition, and scale, made in northern Italy during the second half of the sixteenth century. Kienle masterfully rendered the differentiation of human and equine musculature through the contrast of silver and silver-gilt surfaces, thus animating the already dynamic subject.",

    "tale" : "A leading practitioner of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), Georg Scholz was among a group of young German artists who lived through the cruelty of frontline battle in World War I and returned home to find a weakening economy and mounting political and social problems. They felt that the ills of society were best exposed through the meticulously painted realism of the Old Masters, which evoked Germany’s illustrious past. Combining historical style with images of the nation’s present-day situation, Scholz’s paintings offer a biting critique of the new Weimar Republic’s political and social shortcomings. \nSmall Town by Day is a case in point. At the top of the canvas we are reminded of the mythic ideals of Germany: faith (a priest and the cross of a church illuminated by the sky), family (the woman pushing the carriage and a group of geese walking in an orderly line), the country’s great heritage (the bust of Frederick the Great), and national symbols (an inn called the German Oak). Further down, however, a cold clarity reveals the inner workings of a fictional town in the region of Baden. Nestled within the cozy buildings and streets, we see a cast of characters and the hypocrisy they represent. A puffed-up officer in uniform walks proudly while a wounded vet hobbles in the other direction, a bloated butcher squeezes clean the intestines of a pig as he holds a bloody knife in his mouth, a young boy scoops manure from a horse-drawn hearse, and an elderly woman walks to an outhouse. Scholz’s clear vision lays bare the base and at times sordid activities of a seemingly idyllic setting.",

Mondrian’s Eyeglasses and Pipe is one of a group of beautiful still lifes that the photographer took that day. Within the austere clarity of these simple geometric forms—common manufactured items that Mondrian used daily—Kertész captured the essence of this master of abstraction, both his aspirations to order and his slight and human divergences from it. The insistent angularity of the stark white table is offset by the sculptural curves of the glasses, bowl, and pipe, curves that were rigorously excluded from Mondrian’s art. Throughout Kertész’s long career, he sought the revelation of the found still life, of an abstract or resonating image discovered in an elliptical view. His signature practice of snaring and fixing these lyrical perceptions was facilitated by his later use of light, portable handheld cameras that enabled him to remain mobile and agile even when making still lifes. Kertész’s work significantly influenced that of his contemporaries Brassaï and Henri Cartier-Bresson.",

Influenced by his travels through Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States, Puryear fuses modern traditions—his work pays homage to Constantin Brâncusi, Jean Arp, and Scandinavian furniture designers—with non-Western architecture, sculpture, and craft. Consisting of a tall, narrow, wood vessel and a dramatically arched top flap that seems poised to slam down upon it, Lever #1 exemplifies the artist’s ongoing exploration of the relationship between interior space, form, and volume. The sculpture suggests an array of possible associations, including a deep-hulled boat, a coffin, or sexual themes. It also reflects some of the most celebrated methods of avant-garde art, notably Constructivism and assemblage. While the sculpture alludes to recognizable forms and subjects, Puryear intended for it to remain independent of specific interpretations. The surface is alive with the remnants of glue, staples, and other marks of construction; these residual effects serve as a reminder that, above all else, the work is about the process of making sculpture.",

    "tale" : "In the late 1960s, Sylvia Plimack Mangold turned to her immediate surroundings as a source for imagery, making almost photorealistic paintings of interior spaces, including the wood and tile floors of her studio and home. By the 1970s she began to insert meticulous trompe l’oeil elements as well, including metal rulers and masking tape painted along the borders of her images. The artist has explained that the painted rulers measured or marked the physical dimensions of a work’s edge, while the painted floors measured or marked illusionistic space. In Mangold’s words, “The works of this period were like catalogues of these different realities in painting.” \nIn their constant reappraisal of the relationship between painting and picture, and in their frequent recourse to the grid-like structures of flooring, Mangold’s works can operate like rigorous abstractions, aligned with Minimal and Conceptual practices of the time. Yet they often derive their affect from more subjective, even personal content as well. For instance, the ruler in this painting, which stops on the right edge of the canvas at 66 ¾ inches, serves as an intimate tribute, corresponding to the age of the artist’s father at his death. This is the only work in her oeuvre that offers such an overtly biographical, memorializing reference. The green linoleum floor, which is also exclusive to this work, was inspired by a small section of old flooring the artist discovered in her basement. Here Mangold painted, with her customary precision, an imagined reconstruction as opposed to an observed reality.",

Festooned with ormolu (gilt bronze) swirls and floral swags, the clock required the collaboration of numerous specialized artisans. Its case, candelabra, and wall bracket were created by the eminent Jean-Pierre Latz, who was appointed ébéniste (furniture maker) to the king in 1741. The clock’s eight-day movement was manufactured in the Flemish city of Ghent by Francis Bayley, possibly a member of the large London dynasty of clockmakers of that name. Opulent clocks such as this did more than tell time; they delighted the ear with music (six melody titles are engraved in the dial’s arch) and dazzled the eye with dramatic scenes. Here the Greek god Apollo is poised at the top of the clock case to slay the serpent Python. The space between the clock and the wall bracket was cleverly used to suggest the beast’s home, the cave of Mount Parnassus in Greece. In the triangular base are the faces of Zeus, symbolizing time, and Hera, presiding over marriage and childbirth. They are surmounted by two small coats of arms belonging to the Flemish bride and groom whose union the clock was probably created to celebrate.",

Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun is a snapshot of contemporary life in Japan presented from Taiga’s unique perspective. The print depicts pilgrims making offerings to the Jizo nun, a holy woman believed to be able to communicate with the bodhisattva Jizo, who had the power to save souls in the afterlife. \nGroup Pilgrimage contains an inscription relating the story of the Jizo nun. Taiga was a master calligrapher, poet, and seal carver and was well versed in all forms of writing, from ancient seal script to cursive kana. Here he rendered the inscription in a cursive, informal style very much in keeping with the spontaneity of the painting itself. Taiga was also renowned for his use of finger painting and other odd techniques. Although opinions vary as to whether or not this work is a finger painting, it is clear that Taiga did not use a traditional brush. It seems likely that this could be a “paper twist painting,” in which the artist worked with scraps of twisted paper charged with ink.",

Like those early masters, Li Huayi captured the continuous momentum and flux of nature. Steeply curving banks edged by windswept trees tower precariously over the water, whose receding flow is echoed by the cloud-like mist hovering above. This dynamic image is rendered by the artist’s distinctively expressive method of painting. After defining the composition with large areas of ink spilled onto the paper or worked with a broad brush, Li gradually rendered mass and solidity with denser layers and then allowed the paper to dry before adding details with a small, finely tapered brush. By the artist’s own account, such powerfully fresh landscapes exist only in his mind and do not reflect direct observation of nature.",

Inspired by an 1821 play by the English Romantic poet Lord Byron, the canvas dramatically depicts the last king of the Assyrians. Reclining on his bed moments before his own suicide, the king gazes passively at his wives, concubines, and livestock as they are slain by his order to prevent their slaughter by the enemy army that has just defeated them. In this expressive image of one of the concubines, Delacroix convincingly captured the horror of the moment. With a sure, sweeping line, he described the rhythmic, taut posture of a figure recoiling from a blow or the stab of a knife. Although this powerful figure is significantly truncated in the final painting, the pastel provides insight into Delacroix’s creative process, and its sensual drama is representative of the Romantic period.",

A profusion of figures was molded and applied to its sealed lid, which takes the form of a multistory pavilion. In the balcony-like mouth-rim, a tortoise supports a large vertical tablet, a common form of memorial stone. The real and mythical creatures on the vessel—birds, monkeys, bears, dragons, kneeling figures, and immortals riding dragons—all follow the iconography of early Chinese funerary art. Intermingled with these images, however, are depictions of the Buddha, who is identified by his meditating posture, topknot, and halo. The marginal role of Buddhist art in this decorative scheme reflects the adoption of the alien Indian religion, as the Chinese then understood it, into a hospitable mélange of different spiritual beliefs. Additionally, this jar reflects a formative stage in the development of China’s renowned celadon glaze, which became more uniform in color and texture over subsequent centuries.",

    "tale" : "Herter Brothers, one of New York’s foremost decorating firms during the 1870s and early 1880s, followed the lead of English designers intent on reforming an industry that produced poorly conceived and constructed work by advocating designs that were both beautiful and functional. Brothers Gustave and Christian Herter preferred bold, rectilinear shapes, which they often enlivened, as in this case, with exquisite surface decoration inspired by Japanese art, evidence of the Japanism that was prevalent throughout the West at this time. Here the painted roundels featuring flowers and insects at top left and right of the cabinet emulate Japanese lacquer, while the floral inlay across the facade is reminiscent of patterns found in Japanese screen paintings and textiles. Japanese family crests inspired the bands of inlay across the tops of the doors and above the side compartments, and Japanesque plum blossoms were carved in the arched spandrels on either side of the facade. Nevertheless, the overall form of the cabinet is Western, and the piece also includes such non-Japanesque elements as Egyptian-Revival paw feet. Aesthetic Movement designers such as Herter Brothers readily combined such eclectic motifs as long as they achieved a sense of visual harmony.",

    "tale" : "Inspired by Greek sculpture and Japanese prints, James McNeill Whistler became entranced with portraying the female form clad in diaphanous drapery in the 1890s. He developed this theme in all the media in which he worked, including transfer lithography, oil, pastel, and watercolor. The artist usually provided garments for his models to wear, often classical gossamer gowns with high waists and crossed bodices paired with brightly colored kerchiefs. His models needed a certain degree of strength and agility, as he sometimes asked them to dance about his studio until he found a suitable pose. In Green and Blue: The Dancer, Whistler employed thin watercolor washes to distill the graceful movements of his lissome young model. The brown paper on which he painted lends opacity to the washes, thereby adding subtle weight to the thin veils of fabric draping the figure.",

    "tale" : "While Henri Matisse is perhaps best known as a painter, his simultaneous work in other media—drawing, printmaking, and especially sculpting—was rooted in his earliest artistic experiences and training. In fact, more than half of Matisse’s total output of sculpture (over eighty works) dates to between 1900 and 1909. His three-dimensional pieces reveal a deep interest in the human figure, and in particular the female nude, as well as ancient and Old Master works of art. \nAlthough Matisse’s sculptural production declined after World War I, the works he made while living in Nice continue his earlier interests and relate to his new paintings of odalisques. Seated Nude was inspired by Michelangelo’s Night, a copy of which Matisse studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Nice. The artist worked on the sculpture for almost a decade and extended his exploration of the figure’s pose in numerous drawings and lithographs, at least three paintings, and another sculpture. Over time he slowly increased the size of the figure, making it one of the largest freestanding sculptures in his oeuvre. With its dynamic, cantilevered pose, sharply faceted limbs, and monumental scale, Seated Nude is a study in contrasts, of repose, vitality, and even tension.",

He focused on this subject only during certain phases of his career, and very few of the resulting studies, which he used to prepare biblical or mythological representations, survive today. This strong form is a late work, and one of only four extant drawings of the female nude attributed to Rembrandt with certainty. Unlike the almost scientific realism of his earlier nudes, his late studies are less detailed and more painterly. He attained a maximum of expression with a minimum of means. Rendered with a swift treatment by brush and the blunt reed pen favored by the artist in his late years, this ample figure projects a forceful presence. Her face is generalized, and her feelings are suggested through her contemplative pose. Her simple shape and external immobility seem to increase the viewer’s sense of her inner vitality. In Seated Female Nude, Rembrandt’s penstrokes and brushwork are integrated with the utmost lightness and perfection; the pen stresses structural features, while the brush provides a transparent, atmospheric tone linking figure and space.",

    "tale" : "Ernst Ludwig Kirchner’s Portrait of Otto Mueller—with its vibrant, modulated color and penetrating psychological force—is emblematic of the artist’s innovative approach to technique and imagery. A pivotal figure of the German Expressionist movement, Kirchner first met Mueller, also a painter-printmaker, in 1910. Mueller then joined Die Brücke (The Bridge), the group Kirchner had helped found in 1905, which was instrumental in promoting Expressionism. The period between 1915 and 1919 marked Kirchner’s most concentrated and productive phase of work with portrait prints, which he made primarily as large-format woodcuts. In this depiction of Mueller, Kirchner used a spare, planar composition and broad areas of undifferentiated color to depict his subject’s sharp features. He painted on a single block with a brush and varying colors; thus, each print is unique. The cobalt-blue striated forms that emanate from the figure’s right and from the side of his head in this print are abstract representations of the painted bands that decorated Kirchner’s studio wall, against which Mueller posed. These bands, which Kirchner painted himself, exemplify his adoption of motifs and styles from Palauan art of the South Pacific and resonate with Mueller’s own fondness for African-inspired furniture and wall paintings. Indeed, his hieratic, frontal position may suggest his interest in Egyptian art.",

Such objects served as containers for medals or jewels. This example is richly veneered with marquetry panels of scrolls, strapwork, and vines executed in engraved gilt copper on a ground of tortoiseshell. Framing the panels are strips of ebony and pewter. The coffer also features gilt bronze mounts in the form of male, female, and animal heads. The escutcheon in the center of the front panel may depict the head of Apollo, his long hair braided on either side of his face and gathered in a knot below his chin.

The artist takes her images from the mass media, particularly newspapers and television, and she manipulates them to achieve her desired effect. Characterized by spontaneous brushwork and a subjective use of color, her works merge art-historical and popular-culture references with private, autobiographical allusions. As a white woman who was raised under Apartheid rule in South Africa, some of her strongest works tackle the complicated themes of racial politics. This representation of a black African albino exposes race as a social construct that fails to correspond to identity. By choosing a subject whose very existence complicates the notion of racial categorization, and by rendering his skin tone and hair color in a sickly green hue, Dumas insisted on destabilizing the division between black and white. This work ultimately questions the ability of both skin color and paint to carry meaning.",

Wealthy travelers making the grand tour of Europe—considered an essential part of an education for upper-class men—provided an important market for such views. In this case, however, the patron was not a foreigner passing through Venice, but John Strange, who lived in the city on the lagoon as the British resident, or representative. \nThis view of the garden of a private house in Venice was highly unusual for Guardi. On the right is the rear facade of the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo; the front faces the Grand Canal. The artist’s main subject here is the palace’s formal garden, a luxury in Venice’s crowded urban environment. Elegant couples stroll through the garden’s geometric parterres. Guardi’s attention to the play of light further animates the scene—a shadow cast by an unseen building in the foreground divides the composition and contrasts with the bright light reflected off the facade of the residence and the distant, shimmering lagoon on the left. \nThese observations of light and place probably reflect the aesthetic interests of Strange, who commissioned the painting from Guardi as one of a set of four remarkably original views. Two of the four paintings show Strange’s own villa on the mainland. What connection Strange may have had to the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo is unclear.",

Brilliantly colored and adorned with flicker feathers and dyed cotton string, these effigies once formed an altar as agents for communion with the life-giving spirits of the earth and sky. The large male figure, with his feather necklace and bold black-and-turquoise zigzag pattern, features sky symbolism. The smaller, female figure is a more self-contained form, probably corresponding to the earth. Her ocher color likely refers to maize and pollen, symbols of sustenance and fertility. The accompanying figures are a mountain lion (the chief predator in the region) and two serpents (carved from cottonwood roots), representing agents of communication with the earth and the seasonal cycle of fertility. Curved wooden throwing sticks for rabbit hunting complete the ensemble. Testimony to the antiquity and endurance of the worship of earth and sky and to the spiritual bonds between people and animals, these objects bear close resemblance to ritual figures and implements still used today among the diverse Pueblo peoples.",

Traveling to rugged sites on France’s Mediterranean coast, such as L’Estaque, depicted here, she created landscapes suffused with emotion and subjective expression. Laying down vibrant color in broad unstructured planes, she composed the scene as a collection of loosely joined organic forms. The swelling and tapering shapes along the composition’s edges produce a dynamic sense of movement that dissipates at the center, where we glimpse the calm waters of the Bay of Marseille.\nCharmy was celebrated during her lifetime, but the accolades she received feel wildly gendered today. In 1921, for example, a French writer described her as an artist who “sees like a woman and paints like a man…from the one she takes grace and from the other strength, and this is what makes her such a strange and powerful painter who holds our attention.”"

    "tale" : "Like the vast and untapped landscape of the American West, Carleton Watkins’s photographic images are grand in spirit and in size. Using a giant wet-plate camera whose thick glass negatives—coated with a sensitized emulsion called collodion and exposed while still wet—were often as large as the average easel painting of the time, Watkins here fused a sense of the picturesque with a Romantic expression of nature’s timelessness, immensity, and silence. The trees are sharply defined, still, and majestic. Depicted with equal clarity is the river, which winds into the receding hills. This technical and aesthetic perfection was all the more remarkable considering the difficulty of the wet-plate process for a frontier photographer. In the field, Watkins had to transport (with the aid of several pack mules) mammoth cameras, dark tents, chemicals, and as many as four hundred glass plates.

    "tale" : "During the early 1960s, Georg Baselitz began producing representational images—characterized by thickly painted surfaces and often emotional and\/or tragic themes—that drew inspiration from Germany’s artistic and cultural heritage. Between 1967 and 1969, Baselitz executed a series of Fracture Paintings, in which he segmented his subjects—animals, shepherds, and woodsmen—into horizontal bands or irregular fragments. Strung up sideways against a massive tree trunk, this woodsman heralded the artist’s trademark inverted figures, which first appeared soon after this painting’s completion. Conjuring a world gone mad, Woodman evokes the psychic and physical disorientation Germans experienced after their war-torn nation was partitioned in 1946. Indeed, Baselitz created this work after he left a divided Berlin to reside in a small German village.",

A delicately scalloped gray shape encircles the two friends, and we soon realize that it is the shadow cast by an unseen umbrella. \nThe woman on the right in particular stares confrontationally, as though daring us to gaze at her. She wears a sheer blouse, and her bathing suit and arms are slightly visible beneath it. She has a Western-style bob haircut and one of the newfangled permanent waves popular in the 1930s. Her friend lounges in a sleeveless jumpsuit. At the height of fashion for the beach are their stripes, seen in their clothing and accessories, and even carried into the way the artist, Yamakawa Shūhō, has rendered their hair. They are surrounded by their accessories—a broad-rimmed hat, a ukulele, and a purse shaped like a volleyball with a handle. \nThe woman on the right has been identified as Yamamoto Chiyoko, the daughter of a prominent Tokyo family and one of Shūhō’s students. One day after class, she was to meet a friend, Ota Misuzu, for an excursion to a coastal area close to Tokyo. The artist accompanied them and made sketches for this final composition."

    "tale" : "At first glance, Self-Portrait of My Sister appears to be a relatively straightforward representation of a young woman. It was painted by the Chicago Surrealist Gertrude Abercrombie but seems to lack the mysterious imagery of her landscapes and interior scenes. Further examination, however, reveals subtle touches of her dark aesthetic, beginning with the title itself. Self-Portrait of My Sister is an enigmatic reference to a sister who did not exist, for the artist was in fact an only child. However, Abercrombie initially referred to this painting as “Portrait of Artist as Ideal,” a phrase that reveals her underlying meaning. Abercrombie’s work was invariably self-referential; as she put it, “It’s always myself that I paint, but not actually, because I don’t look that good or cute.” Her reference to a fictitious, prettier sister hints at her desire to be a different person, a longing she satisfied through self-portraiture. \nHere, the artist exaggerated and idealized her appearance, depicting herself with an extraordinarily long, slender neck; vivid blue eyes; and sharpened features. She portrayed herself wearing black gloves and a flat-brimmed hat trimmed with a bunch of grapes, all motifs that recurred with some frequency in her paintings and acted as symbols of her presence. Such inclusions helped shape her individual variant of Surrealism, which she felt was based in realism. “Surrealism is meant for me,” she remarked, “because I am a pretty realistic person but don’t like all I see. So I dream that it is changed. Then I change it to the way I want it. It is almost always pretty real. Only mystery and fantasy have been added. All foolishness has been taken out. It becomes my own dream.”",

Eye problems arising from lead-based oil paint poisoning were the partial cause of this dramatic change. Of his thirteen extant pastel self-portraits, the most famous are versions of the example seen here, with the casually dressed, aging artist in his studio. A virtuoso colorist, the septuagenarian here revealed a joyously free stroke and palette. Nonetheless, the construction of the figure is solid and rigorous, adding to his powerful presence. This composition was created at the same time as a portrait of the artist’s wife for the 1775 Salon (Musée du Louvre, Paris). A year later, Chardin—with greater daring—replicated the pair. These later portraits were separated for almost two hundred years, until they were reunited in the collection of the Art Institute.",

    "tale" : "Joseph Wright, a leading artist of the eighteenth century, spent most of his life in the central Midlands town of Derby, where he ran a successful portrait-painting practice. His best work in this vein portrays solid middle-class citizens, much like himself, with a keen perceptiveness of both character and physical appearance. Throughout his career, Wright was preoccupied with the evocative effects of light, specifically those produced by a single light source such as a candle, and the resulting play of shadows. Influenced by the powerful chiaroscuro of the superb mezzotints of Thomas Frye, a contemporary printmaker, Wright produced a number of dramatically lit self-portraits in oil, charcoal, and black-and-white pastel during the mid-1760s. Depicting himself in nocturnal lighting, wearing an exotic black hat, the artist evoked a time-honored tradition in portraiture: the deeply pensive artist who confronts himself and the viewer with a quiet challenge. Wright later ventured into landscape and genre subjects, the most original of which are concerned with the exploration of light phenomena. Portrait commissions continued to be a reliable source of income throughout his career.",

    "tale" : "“Unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory fact,” read the monograph that accompanied Walker Evans’s photographs when many of them were displayed at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1938. Taken during the preceding two years, while he traveled throughout the South for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) under the direction of Roy Stryker, these images document the plight of the rural poor during the Depression. With clinical precision and a fastidious reserve, Evans photographed main streets, storefronts, hand-painted signs, gas stations, abandoned buildings, and automobiles. He took pictures of tenant farmers’ homes—their kitchens, beds, bureau drawers, and fireplaces—with and without their occupants. Taken for Fortune magazine while Evans, on leave from the FSA, was traveling with the writer James Agee, this famous photograph shows a tenant farmer’s wife standing outside her house. With patient dignity, she looks straight at the viewer, a shy half-smile on her lips. This work is part of a remarkable collaboration with Agee published in the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). As one of the nation’s finest documentary photographers, Evans continued this exacting and lucid description of American culture throughout his career.",

He was born in Nuremberg and first trained as a goldsmith in his father’s shop before apprenticing with the painter Michael Wolgemut. One of his earliest animal drawings, Young Steer shows its subject grazing in an unseen field. The artist’s sure strokes and adept cross-hatching delineate the steer’s sculptural form, with taut skin stretched over a strong yet bony frame. Dürer’s precise draftsmanship recalls the drawings and prints of the celebrated German master Martin Schongauer, whom he greatly admired. This work was probably a study from nature; sketchy lines around the animal’s right hind foot, back, muzzle, and horns reveal that the artist originally drew the steer in a slightly different position, with his mouth open. A masterful engraver who would elevate printmaking to an expressive art form over the course of his career, Dürer employed the steer’s hindquarters for the barnyard scene in his engraving The Prodigal Son amid the Swine (1494\/96), an impression of which is in the Art Institute.",

The emphasis on fashion in this painting is characteristic of much of Johnson’s portraiture. When permitted, the artist preferred to bedeck his female sitters with jewelry. Mrs. Beatty’s hair is bound with a double circlet of light glass beads that accentuates her brown hair and gray eyes.

    "tale" : "Chaekgeori are Korean still-life paintings that were popular during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty. Three-dimensional effects were commonly used in chaekgeori, as was reversed perspective, in which distant objects are shown larger than those nearby, thus flattening the pictorial surface. These different treatments of spatial illusion resulted in compositions with a highly graphic feel that is enhanced by the decorative patterning on the depicted objects. It is clear that such still-life images did not have realism as a goal. Instead, chaekgeori (defined as “painting[s] of books and associated things”) were seen as conveyers of cultural values. They were most often displayed within studios or schools and reflected reverence for scholarship and learning. In this screen, scholarly tools are depicted along with flowers, plants, food, rare imported objects, and religious implements. These motifs express varied meanings; for example, eggplant represents the promise of a long life, while musical instruments symbolize harmony among people. Such a profusion of auspicious meanings indicates that chaekgeori may not have been restricted to the scholarly environment; they may also have served as talismans ensuring harmony within the home and beyond.",

    "tale" : "Alfred Stieglitz campaigned throughout the first half of the twentieth century to legitimize photography and modern art. He founded an exhibiting organization, the Photo-Secession, then the periodical Camera Work, and finally a series of galleries. The most influential of these, the gallery known simply as 291, operating from 1908 until 1917, introduced the work of such leaders of the European avant-garde as Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Georgia O’Keeffe, who became Stieglitz’s wife in 1924, was among the progressive American artists whose work he also exhibited at 291. In a search for objective truth and pure form, the innovative photographer took some five hundred photographs of O’Keeffe between 1917 and 1937. The essence of O’Keeffe, he felt, was not confined to her head and face alone; equally expressive were her torso, feet, and especially her hands, as seen here. What resulted is a “composite portrait” of the painter, in which each photograph, revealing her intrinsic nature at a particular moment, can stand alone as an independently expressive form. When these serial images are viewed as a whole, they portray the essence of O’Keeffe’s many different “selves.” \nFor more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",

In this monumental portrait, therefore, we are looking not only at an unusual subject matter but also at a study of an extraordinary simian: one with human features complete with a beard, pale eyes, and long, slender hands. The inscription on the back of this work, written in Devanagari, states that the monkey is named Husaini and “comes from” Nawab Davad (or Daud) Khan. This name most likely refers to Daud Khan Panni, a powerful nobleman and a faujdar (a military commander and territorial administrator) who served the Mughal emperors from Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) through Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713–19), in various parts of India. The painting has been dated to 1705\/10 and is attributed to the anonymous artist now called the Stipple Master. Working in tandem with his patron Maharana Amar Singh II of Mewar (r. 1698–1710), this artist was the initiator of a new painting style in Mewar in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. A group of about forty-six paintings, including the present work, has now been attributed to this artist-patron duo.",

    "tale" : "In 1922 the Art Institute’s recently opened Burnham Library of Architecture com-missioned Louis Sullivan to make drawings illustrating his renowned theories of architectural ornament. These masterpieces were published together as A System of Architectural Ornament, According with a Philosophy of Man’s Powers by the American Institute of Architects in 1924; this was Sullivan’s final statement about the geometry underlying both natural and man-made forms. In his search for an original American architecture, Sullivan drew his inspiration from nature, not unlike the nineteenth-century American poets and writers whom he emulated. Like them, he intended ornament to function evocatively as well as to represent organic growth, evolving from closed geometric units to open, efflorescent forms. In Impromptu!, the sixteenth of the twenty delicate drawings in his treatise, Sullivan produced one of his most open, vibrant, and fluent compositions. Giving free rein to expansive whiplash appendages and spiral stalks, the architect combined nature’s infinite creative variation and incessant change with an intense emotional expressionism. To convey these poetic nuances, Sullivan’s correlating notation describes the design as entering “the domain of Virtuosity, Romance and Symbolism.”",

    "tale" : "Born in Beijing, Zao Wou-ki moved to Paris in 1948. He had studied at China’s most progressive art academy, training in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting and calligraphy. Despite his education, Zao’s arrival in the cosmopolitan French capital prompted for him a more tangible, as well as conceptual, reckoning with Eastern and Western aesthetics. However, it was not until he traveled to the United States, where he viewed Abstract Expressionist paintings for the first time, did the artist embrace exclusively the atmospheric abstraction for which he became known. After returning to Paris, Zao began to create sweeping, large-scale compositions and swiftly rose to prominence among a circle of fellow Paris-based abstract painters interested in lyrical and intuitive mark making, including American Joan Mitchell and German-born Hans Hartung. \nIn The Night is Stirring, Zao built up layers of jewel-toned color, activated by touches of lurid red and a torquing column that seems to climb up the center of the canvas. While his dark, inky brushstrokes call to mind Chinese calligraphy, still more traditional Chinese painting is reflected through Zao’s manipulation of the tropes of the landscape format, which emphasizes the rhythmsand energies of nature more than a strictly realistic approach. Suspended between the conventions of Chinese landscape painting and the materiality of Western oil painting, Zao’s canvas occupies other in-between states as well; it is, for example, an abstract work that suggests not only landscape in general but nightfall more specifically. Zhang borrowed the title from a book of poems by writer and painter Henri Michaux, a close friend and mentor.",

    "tale" : "Ed Paschke is celebrated as one of the leading figures of the Chicago Imagist Movement, a group of late-1960s artists whose expressive style of figurative painting was rooted in outsider art, popular culture, and Surrealism. Drawing inspiration from New York–based Pop Art, Paschke often culled his subjects from newspapers, tabloid magazines, and television, producing work that taps into the movement’s kitsch aesthetic. Although his paintings depict representational imagery, they play heavily upon expressionist distortion, particularly in his use of psychedelic, inharmonious colors. Paschke’s love of urban subcultures and his interest in the underbelly of American society translated into a penchant for sensational subject matter. In his early works, Paschke painted circus freaks and other marginal figures, in marked contrast to, for example, Andy Warhol’s overriding concern with mainstream celebrity. Minnie, which depicts a now-anonymous individual silhouetted against a background of emanating light, is typical of his artistic production from this period. With her theatrical costume, elaborate hairdo, and bizarre makeup, this larger-than-life figure becomes a grotesque. By painting a flamboyant, overtly sexualized underworld character in a peculiar mixture of electric hues, Paschke added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic.",

After locating a wealth of material on World War II—a conflict that was the backdrop of her childhood in Latvia—Celmins employed subtle layers of precise brushstrokes to construct a detailed image of an attack on an aircraft carrier.

He moved to West Germany in the 1960s, becoming one of a number of German artists who sought to confront the collective trauma that characterized the history of their nation in the 20th century. The watchtower referred to in the title may indicate a type of elevated seat frequently used in the German countryside as a lookout when hunting fowl, a reference underscored by a gaggle of geese in the painting’s right-hand corner. The designs on the black fabric evoke the pleasures of leisure time at a beach and provide an association with another kind of raised chair, that of a lifeguard. But, more ominously, the watchtower is also related to guard towers, prisons, concentration camps, and walled countries."

    "tale" : "This painting by represents one of the most popular compositions invented by one of the most distinguished painters working in Rome during the High Renaissance. In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian Giorgio Vasari stated that“first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.” \nChrist Carrying the Cross draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression. \nThe popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.",

    "tale" : "Jasper Johns began his career in the mid-1950s by re-creating, with great precision, such familiar images as targets, letters, numbers, and flags. Although his subject matter has become less commonplace, he continues to “borrow” from the public domain. Perilous Night, for instance, owes its title to a pivotal and expressive piece of music written by the American composer John Cage (1912–1992) in 1945. Both score and cover sheet are rendered on the right-hand side of the drawing with Johns’s characteristically fluid handling of ink. On the sheet’s left side is a freehand rendition—abstracted, reversed, and turned ninety degrees—of a single, terror-stricken soldier from the Resurrection panel of Matthias Grünewald’s sixteenth-century masterwork the Isenheim Altarpiece (Unterlinden Museum, Colmar). Between the soldier and the musical score is a black imprint of Johns’s right arm, evidence perhaps of the creative power that can merge two disparate images into a cogent statement. The overcome soldier witnessing the Resurrection of Christ and a piece of music marking a key transition in a composer’s career both point to “perilous nights” that can change the course of a human life. Characteristically, Johns also explored the same subject in different media. This somberly colored drawing derives from a painting of the same name (1982; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC).",

    "artist" : "Jean Honoré Fragonard",
    "tale" : "Jean-Honoré Fragonard is perhaps best known for his light-hearted, amorous subjects, which seem to embody the spirit of eighteenth-century France. This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of Fragonard’s genius—in a series of fantasy portraits, he used references to earlier artists to enliven his own characterizations of his patrons and artistic friends. Here the identity of the sitter is unknown; however, the half-length format, the rapid, virtuoso handling of the paint, and the use of seventeenth-century costume link this work to the fantasy portraits. In this instance, Fragonard took as his starting point a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti, then in a leading Parisian collection; in other related portraits, the French painter was inspired by the bravura style of the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. Two paintings from this series bear inscriptions stating that they were painted in one hour. Whether or not this is literally true, the direct, personal quality that results from Fragonard’s command of the medium makes this series particularly appealing to a modern sensibility.",

Cisterns such as this were filled with cold water and used to cool wine bottles at feasts. Skillfully decorated by the Italian ceramic painter Francesco Durantino, this work typifies the Renaissance interest in both Christian imagery and scenes from pagan antiquity. It is covered with depictions of two famous battle scenes, one on land and one at sea. Although the exterior, adapted from frescoes by Raphael’s followers, represents a land battle culminating in the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine I to Christianity, the cistern’s interior depicts a legendary naval disaster: the sinking of the Trojan hero Aeneas’s ships by the jealous goddess Hera. At the cistern’s center, the ships disappear beneath the waves, a playful conceit that was no doubt even more effective when the cistern was filled with water. The generously sized vessel displays all the characteristics that made maiolica, a tin-glazed earthenware, popular: brilliant colors, lively painting, and riveting narratives mixed with fanciful design. The term maiolica probably comes from Majorca, the port through which pottery from Moorish Spain was first exported to Italy.",

    "tale" : "The largely self-taught Yves Tanguy decided to become an artist around 1923, when he was inspired by a painting by Giorgio de Chirico that he saw in a shop window. Tanguy became interested in Surrealism a year later, after reading the periodical La révolution surréaliste. André Breton welcomed him into the Surrealist group in 1925. Inspired by the metaphysical qualities of de Chirico’s work, as well as the biomorphic forms of Jean Arp, Max Ernst, and Joan Miró, Tanguy quickly developed his own fantastic vocabulary of organic, amoeba-like shapes that populate mysterious, dreamlike settings. \nTanguy painted this primordial landscape on a hinged wooden screen. Little information exists about the circumstances of the work’s making, but the artist probably intended it for a patron’s home, since many Surrealists were interested in the decorative arts and produced folding screens, furniture, and other domestic objects. In this unusual example, although the screen retains the potential to close off the private sphere, it simultaneously opens up more intimate dreams and fantasies to the outside world.",

First staged in 1934 with an all-black cast, the work featured a libretto by Gertrude Stein and striking cellophane sets and costumes by Stettheimer, which achieved instant notoriety. \nStettheimer developed her unique blend of faux-naive art and avant-garde innovations during the 1910s. With little concern for proportion or perspective, the artist depicted fantastic scenes, combining past and present, real and imagined, near and far, which she populated with slim, stylized figures who seem to float or dance through space. In this painting, an ecstatic-looking Thomson, awash in a flood of supernatural light, gazes at a mask bearing Stein’s features, which seems to represent a source of inspiration. Alluding to music’s heavenly quality, this encounter between creative forces takes place on a bank of clouds, complete with a tiny stage and actors, lettered banners, and fluttering doves. \nThe chained lion to the right of Thomson might refer to the power of music to soothe even savage beasts or to Saint Jerome and the Evangelist Mark, who are frequently depicted in the company of lions. Reinforcing the link between creativity and spirituality are banners that combine the names of two saints from the opera, Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Ávila, with those of Thomson and Stein. However, the artist’s own name—Florine St.—appears in reverse order to the others, perhaps a witty abbreviation of her signature. Stettheimer designed the scalloped frame, which appropriately sets off her fanciful vision."

    "tale" : "Agnes Martin mastered a rigorously pared-down idiom that combined painting and drawing. The artist aligned herself with Abstract Expressionists such as Mark Rothko, admiring their investigations of chromatic color schemes, allover compositions, and emotional content. In the 1960s, she developed a vocabulary of grids and graphs that prompted critics to compare her work to the radical simplicity and intellectualism of Minimal and Conceptual artists. Indeed, Untitled #12—a crisply stated graphite grid on a light-gray ground—seems at first to be an exemplar of Minimalism. But close observation reveals a flickering light and extremely refined touch that suggest a spiritual, rather than purely aesthetic, stance. Martin’s deeply solitary nature led her to achieve a quiet, tenuous balance between the material and the immaterial, the sensual and the austere. \nThe artist stopped painting in 1969; she moved from New York City to a remote, rural area of New Mexico. In 1975, she began to paint again. Although Martin maintained that her art was not abstracted from nature —“Work like mine,” she remarked, “describes the subtle emotions that are beyond words, like music”—the paintings she produced in the Southwest embody the quiet landscapes, even light, and desert tonalities of her surroundings.",

    "tale" : "This style of high-backed seat with bone and ivory inlay, known as a “chair of power” or “grandee’s chair” (kiti cha enzi), is a graphic reminder of the complex history of international trade and conquest in the region known as the Swahili Coast. As early as the first century, the region’s natural harbors invited exchange with partners in the Persian Gulf and Western India. Later the Portuguese, Omani, and British imposed their authority on its inhabitants. With each conquering state, newly imported goods and practices took root as symbols of authority and power among the Swahili elite. The upright form of the kiti cha enzichair bears strong resemblance to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century chairs imported from Portugal and Spain, as well as to Portuguese- and Spanish-influenced examples made in India. Comparisons have also been made with chairs from the Mamluk period (1250–1517) in Egypt. In any case, the Swahili version is clearly the result of foreign influences that have been artfully synthesized and reshaped by local artisans. Most such chairs in collections today date from the nineteenth century and were made in large, specialized workshops. They could be found conspicuously displayed in wealthy households along the Swahili Coast into the first half of the twentieth century.",

The substantial body of work she created shows her sustained development toward a refined expression of this concept. Black and White is one of Krasner’s first and most important works in a group of early paper collages. The drawings that she disassembled to create these collages echo the work of her husband, Jackson Pollock, from the same period. According to the art historian Ellen Landau, however, it is difficult to determine who originated the strategy of cannibalizing previous works to create new ones. Throughout her career, Krasner employed the technique more consistently than Pollock. \nIn Black and White, Krasner not only appropriated her own discarded markings but also referred to Pollock’s early-1940s tactic of quoting Pablo Picasso’s studio subjects. She reversed the gender implications of Picasso’s prototypes by showing, at right, a female figure who may be a painter contemplating her works of art, or perhaps a woman looking in a mirror. The artist’s redeployment of studio scraps in a new context helped her, paradoxically, to mark out new aesthetic territory.",

    "tale" : "A key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement, Barnett Newman is widely considered one of the most innovative and influential painters of the twentieth century. A brilliant colorist and a master of expansive spatial effects, he pioneered a new pictorial language that was at once emphatically abstract and powerfully emotive. For Newman, the spiritual content of abstract art was of paramount importance. Although his works seem largely focused on the formal qualities of painting, he insisted that they possessed symbolic meaning. This meaning was never explicit, but he often alluded to it in the titles of his works, as with The Beginning. In the mid-1940s Newman became preoccupied with the Old Testament story of Creation and began selecting titles in reference to the book of Genesis. In this painting, the bands of paint that emerge from the base of the canvas interrupt a richly variegated field of color, a sort of primordial fog. The artist created these three stripes with the aid of masking tape, which he applied to the canvas as a guideline before adding the surrounding color. This work is an important precursor to Newman’s mature paintings, which are characterized by a single vertical band, or “zip,” that divides the composition.",

    "tale" : "Because many textiles made by early Egyptians were preserved in arid tombs, a substantial number of these fabrics have survived in remarkably good condition. This striking portion of a wall hanging depicts a figure standing beneath a colonnaded, arched opening. With raised arms, which perhaps once held candelabrum, he wears a traditional tunic with clavic bands (the narrow strips extending down from the shoulders, on the front and back, to the waist or hem). This woven piece is distinguished by its large size, imposing composition, and brilliant, unfaded shades of red, green, blue, brown, and yellow. The figure’s commanding frontality, solemn expression, and animated side glance, together with the composition’s bold lines and vivid colors, relate this fragment to hauntingly realistic portrait icons. Also suggestive of icons is the three-dimensional appearance of the warrior’s face and legs and the columns—an effect much easier to achieve in painting than in weaving. Woven of indigenous materials, this hanging is composed of linen warps and wool and linen wefts that create an uncut pile against a plain-weave foundation, a fabric surface less common in Byzantine textiles than the tapestry weave.",

    "tale" : "Celebrated as the “poet of architects and architect of all the arts,” Edward William Godwin was a man of many accomplishments. In a career that spanned more than thirty-five years, he was an architect of civic, domestic, and ecclesiastical buildings; an innovative interior decorator and designer of furniture, textiles, and theater sets; and an articulate critic of art and architecture. Godwin first designed his ebonized sideboard, of which this is a variant model, for his own dining room in 1867, and he subsequently reconsidered the form over the next two decades. In its appearance, the sideboard represents a turning away from the weight of contemporary Gothic Revival aesthetics and a move toward a reductionist sensibility expressed through the balance of solids and voids. This spare style gained Godwin some notable contemporary clients, among them James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. In his 1904 study The English House, the influential German critic Hermann Muthesius wrote that Godwin’s furniture, including this sideboard, foreshadowed the more modern look that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. While calling Godwin’s creations “wildly picturesque,” Muthesius concluded that the overall effect was “one of elegance.”",

    "tale" : "The remarkable artistic career of Pablo Picasso spanned more than seven decades and influenced nearly every major trend in the first half of the twentieth century. One of the last works of Picasso’s Blue Period (1901–4), this large, hauntingly expressive etching was completed just after the artist settled permanently in France and moved into a dilapidated Montmartre tenement nicknamed the Bateau-Lavoir (“washerwoman’s boat”). During this time, the struggling artist’s palette and the mood of his particular cast of characters—the poor, ill, and outcast—were dominated by the color blue, then symbolically associated with melancholy. In this austere etching, two subjects that fascinated Picasso—couples in cafés and the solitude of the blind—are brought to refinement. The man’s emaciated face is in profile, while the woman stares directly at the viewer, emphasizing the blindness of her companion. Their angular bodies and elongated fingers and the chalky, cold light recall works by El Greco. The Frugal Meal, which was only Picasso’s second attempt at printmaking, reveals the artist’s extraordinary gift for draftsmanship and his remarkable facility with new media and techniques.",

This sculpture represents Michael’s battle against Satan, who lies at his feet, pierced by the saint’s lance. This subject would inevitably have been associated with the hope of salvation, since Saint Michael was often depicted weighing the souls of the blessed and the damned in images of the Last Judgment. This wood sculpture is a powerful example of the inﬂuence of trends from northern Europe on the art of Spain in the second half of the fifteenth century through the importation of works of art and craftsmen. The angular, dancing rhythm of the saint’s pose and the tight, graphic quality of the details of his shield, hair, and wings may reﬂect sources in northern European prints, such as the engravings of Master E. S. These elements would originally have been enhanced by a painted and gilded surface, which at some point was stripped away.",

He came in contact with a group of artists, including Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, who saw abstraction as an almost spiritual vehicle for the reconstruction of art and society. Their approach, known as De Stijl (The Style), was marked by fundamentals: geometry combined with asymmetry; pure primary colors with black and white; and positive and negative elements. Motivated by his belief in this utopian aesthetic, Vantongerloo joined the De Stijl group in 1917, its founding year. \nIn 1919 he embarked on a series of sculptures based on the interrelation of masses. Interrelation of Volumes from the Ellipsoid, the fifth in the group, explores the intersections of a parallel-faced polyhedron within an ovoid volume. To produce this work, the artist mapped the intersecting volumes of forms from different views in order to reveal core geometric units and planes. While this sculpture was inspired by mathematical principles, it is not a sterile, scientific object but, in its realized form, suggests an element of human invention in the mold marks and alterations that Vantongerloo considered part of the artistic process.",

In some of their designs, the Campanas use cast-off materials in a way that invites social commentary; in others, they combine rigid steel and informally layered everyday elements, suggesting the confluence of Modernist aesthetics and popular culture that is constantly at play in their work. Corallo Chair, their most ambitious piece to date, illustrates their interest in operating at the frontier of art and design. Made of bent steel wire and painted bright coral, each chair is handcrafted, ensuring that no two are the same. The branchlike form, taken from shapes found in nature, is a response to the chair’s function as an outdoor seating element. Ultimately, however, what anchors the Campanas’ efforts is a divine optimism that something beautiful can result from limited means.",

    "tale" : "With a lively combination of realism and caricature, this detail of the painting Yang Pu Moving His Family depicts a group of peasants transporting a rustic scholar and his family across a stream. Distinguished by his official government cap, with its long streamers, the otherwise disheveled, bare-legged scholar bids farewell to his neighbors on the shore. Servants valiantly attempt to carry children and the family’s belongings—scrolls, furniture, and dishes—through the water. The scholar depicted here may represent Yang Pu, a character described in stories of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). According to folklore, Yang Pu initially declined, and then reluctantly accepted, his appointment to a government position in the capital city. Chinese law forbade civil officials from working in their native districts, and as a result, many were required to relocate to distant cities. Painters and poets frequently depicted the theme of farewell, or “noble parting,” exemplified by the story of Yang Pu. The twigs that protrude from the official caps of the men depicted here may allude to the ancient Chinese custom of presenting departing friends with small branches from a willow tree.",

The grid format of his composition includes frames in which the mother’s and daughter’s faces and hands are captured together, as well as separate frames in which they gaze back at the artist. In the wholesome beauty of this loving family bond, Bey constructed a cohesive sanctuary apart from the horrors and ambiguities of our time.",

    "tale" : "Representative of the early work of Lorenzo Monaco, a Camaldolese monk and leading Florentine painter of the end of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth century, the delicate colors and simplified forms of this Crucifixion are exceptionally well preserved. The medallion above the crucified Christ contains an image of Christ in Glory, holding a palm in each hand to symbolize his victory over death. Below, the crowned figure of King David holds an inscribed scroll. More often in Crucifixion scenes of this period, a pelican appears at the top of the cross and the skull of Adam lies at the foot. A penitential theme is suggested by the figures kneeling under the Cross: on the right is a haloed Magdalen in a red robe; on the left, a man with the incised rays of a beatus, or blessed one, emanating from his head wears the torn brown cloak of a hermit. He was probably meant to represent a specific hermit within the Camaldolese order. The panel has a hole drilled at the base, allowing it to be mounted on a pole and used as a processional cross, likely in the monastic Camaldolese community of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Lorenzo lived and worked.",

    "tale" : "During the past four decades, Brice Marden has played a key role in maintaining the vitality of abstract painting. Rodeo, a work of imposing scale and stark presence, represents a high point of his early career. Two rectangular canvas panels—one yellow, the other gray—are joined to form an eight-foot square. Each canvas is pulled across a deep (two and one-eighth-inch) stretcher and painted with a combination of oil and beeswax. The stretchers and thick, opaque pigment give Rodeo a sense of weight and a sculptural presence. Like all of Marden’s paintings, Rodeo is insistently handmade. The artist laid multiple layers of the medium over his canvas panels, adding an extraordinary sense of tactility to this relatively simple composition. The line joining the two panels may suggest a horizon line, and thus a landscape. The juxtaposition of two rectangular fields also recalls the work of Mark Rothko. In contrast to Rothko’s luminous, floating fields of color, Marden’s twin panels seem determinedly earthbound, presented as physical facts rather than as expressions of spiritual aspiration.",

    "tale" : "In 1964 the artist Leonora Carrington painted this imaginative portrait of her friend, the self-taught artist Juan Soriano. A member of Surrealist circles in Paris and New York City during the 1930s and 1940s, Carrington settled in Mexico in 1942 after the trauma of fleeing war-torn Europe. Mexico occupied an important place in the imagination of many European artists—André Breton’s called it the “Surrealist place par excellence”—and for Carrington the country came to be a source of inspiration and wonder. \nJuan Soriano De Lacandón was one of the first paintings in which Carrington combined her Surrealist-inspired dreamscapes with Mexico’s history, culture, and ancient practices. Inspired by her study of the indigenous Lacandón people for a 1963 mural commission, The Magical World of the Maya (Museo de Antropología e Historia, Mexico City), the artist portrayed Soriano surrounded by the flora and fauna of ancient Mayan mythology. Bearing the scarification marks of a shaman, he holds in his hand a small jaguar, admired by the Maya as a spiritually powerful creature and a conduit to the underworld. According to native belief, the shaman alone was privileged to assume the form of the jaguar. This notion of animal incarnation may have resonated with Carrington, who adopted the horse as a type of alter ego in her earlier work. In presenting Soriano as a revered holy man, the artist demonstrated her deep admiration for her subject. Her use of precolonial symbolism also suggests her assimilation into the world of her adopted homeland, where she remained until her death.",

    "tale" : "Trained as an architect in Vienna and Berlin, Paul T. Frankl immigrated to New York in 1914 and established his own gallery. There he began to design interiors and champion the skyscraper as a source of a uniquely American modernist vision. The impetus behind the Skyscraper Cabinet, however, was distinctly rural. Frankl spent the summer of 1925 in Woodstock, New York, sketching ideas for new furniture designs and renovating his cabin. In an effort to organize his books, he fitted boards together to create a cabinet with “a rather large, bulky lower section and a slender, shallow upper part going straight to the ceiling. It had a new look; the neighbors came and said, ‘It looks just like the new skyscrapers.’” From then on, Frankl experimented with spare, geometric furniture that mimicked the setback contours of New York skyscrapers. By 1926 these pieces were touted in Good Furniture magazine as the “sky-scraper type of furniture, which is as American and as New Yorkish as Fifth Avenue itself.” The Art Institute’s monumental cabinet epitomizes Frankl’s designs. Its geometric form rests on a sharply molded base and consists of a bottom cabinet section surmounted by a series of compartments and shelves arranged in a pyramidlike fashion. Smooth, unadorned surfaces exemplify the tenets of modernist design.",

The two became lasting friends, and Eddy published a book on Whistler after the artist’s death in 1903. Unlike contemporaneous artists such as John Singer Sargent, who relied upon flamboyant brushwork to convey his painterly virtuosity, Whistler favored thinly painted compositions, which he called “arrangements” to emphasize color rather than subject matter. This portrait is one of Whistler’s finest, displaying the delicate color harmonies that characterize his art-for-art’s-sake mentality.",

    "tale" : "Claude Cahun, born Lucy Schwob, was closely associated with the Paris Surrealists of the 1930s. Attracted to the group’s desire to transform society through the exploration of the unconscious, she challenged traditional ideas about gender and sexuality through her intimate photographic self-portraits, collages, and sculptures. For Object, Cahun altered a number of seemingly unrelated components—a doll’s hand, a cloud-shaped piece of wood, and a tennis ball painted with a wide-open eye—to produce a startling psychological resonance. The eye, in particular, a key Surrealist symbol of inner perception, also suggests female anatomy. On the base of the work, Cahun added the French phrase, “The Marseillaise is a revolutionary song, the law punishes counterfeiters with forced labor.” Much like the rest of the work, the inscription is a juxtaposition of disparate elements: the first, a well-known slogan from France’s antifascist coalition, the left-wing Popular Front, and the other, a phrase from Belgian currency. In combining these phrases, Cahun seems to point an accusatory finger at the supposed “revolutionary” leaders of France—a rare direct reference to politics in a Surrealist artwork. Her assemblages were typically ephemeral and made to be photographed; Object is the only sculptural work by the artist known to still exist in its original form.",

In 1889 Wright built a house for his young family on Forest Avenue in Oak Park, a new suburb just west of Chicago; ten years later, he opened an attached studio and designed it and the home’s interior in accordance with his philosophy of simplicity and integrity of materials. Among his furniture experiments were heavy, solid cube chairs. By the first decade of the twentieth century, Wright had refined his early design into that of this chair, adding spindles, a subtly tapering crest rail, and gently curving leg ends to produce an effect that is equal parts sophistication and simplicity. The spindles themselves were a legacy of William Morris–inspired ladder-back dining chairs, as well as the Arts and Crafts approach of contrasting positive and negative space. This chair was also influenced by the reticulated ceilings and walls of Japanese homes."

    "tale" : "Born in Turkish Armenia, Arshile Gorky immigrated to the United States in the 1920s and became an influential member of the New York art scene. Profoundly interested in avant-garde European art, he experimented with a variety of styles. Young artists working in New York were particularly stimulated by the European Surrealists, many of whom moved to the city before and during World War II and whose circle Gorky joined. The 1940s, especially the years 1944–47, marked the creation of his most important work, produced in a kind of stream of consciousness or “automatic” manner of painting. The Plough and the Song reflects the artist’s indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Miró, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are hallmarks of Gorky’s mature work. A delicate contour line delineates the biomorphic forms in the center of the composition, in marked contrast to the loose brushwork that defines the background. The title signals Gorky’s nostalgia for his heritage, as the artist wrote in 1944: “You cannot imagine the fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows… . And the songs, our ancient songs of the Armenian people, our suffering people… . So many shapes, so many shapes and ideas, happily a secret treasure to which I have been entrusted the key.” Deeply earthbound and poetic, The Plough and the Song is at once a still life, a landscape, and a fantasy.",

In the Popol Vuh, a sixteenth-century epic of the K’iche’ Maya, the death and resur¬rection of the maize god was likened to seed corn that sprouted and produced new life. This vessel from the Late Classic period (600–800) depicts a Maya ruler attired as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. On his back, the ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems. Just as maize plants sway to and fro, the maize god dances to the rhythm of life—often, as seen here, in the company of a dwarf. Among the Maya, dwarfs were seen as special beings with powerful spiritual connections to the earth and the interior world below. This vase refers to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased into the domain of the dead, from which it would eventually be reborn in the royal lineage, just as maize sprouts again in the cycle of nature’s renewal. This vase of the Dancing Lords may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.",

Carefully twisted strands of clay realistically depict the fur-like texture of the animal’s saddle blanket. The woman’s full proportions—evident in the folds of her flowing, wide-sleeved robe, as well as in her plump cheeks and double chin—are enhanced by her loosely gathered coiffure, which is topped with a dangling forehead bun. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty.

Stylistically, the painting fuses landscape and genre, and Johnson further imbued the scene with a Barbizon, plein-air sensibility. The autumnal palette is interspersed with bright patches of red, blue, and green that appear like sparks amidst the shimmering gold of the cornhusks. Johnson carefully included a woman discovering a red ear of corn, which, according to folk tradition, would allow her to kiss the person of her choice. This combination of indigenous subject matter and an international style was typical of American art around the time of the country’s centennial.",

    "tale" : "As a student of the renowned photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in the 1970s, Thomas Struth absorbed their objective, methodical style of making pictures, often emphasizing the camera’s single-point perspective. To his varied subject matter—city streets, rainforests, family portraits—Struth brings an acute awareness of the act of observation. His use of relatively great depth of field allows him to lead the viewer’s eye to certain details and gloss over other ones. \nStruth’s celebrated Museum Photographs series is composed of monumental images of museum visitors in various stages of observation, captivation, and even distraction. As part of this series, Art Institute of Chicago II depicts a woman pushing a stroller facing Gustave Caillebotte’s famous Paris Street; Rainy Day, while another woman reads the label. The women’s clothing harmonizes remarkably with the palette of the painting, and the gallery’s marble floor seems transformed into a continuation of the wet cobblestones rendered so believably by Caillebotte’s paintbrush. As historian Hans Belting concluded of this work, “One no longer knows what is inside the painting and what is in front of it… . We feel like rubbing our eyes when the space in front of the painting transforms itself into a picture that is not separated from the painting.”",

Commissioned to design sets and costumes inspired by the local flamenco tradition, she discovered radial lines in the delicate transparencies of lace and floral patterns adorning the costumes of her subjects. The axes formed by the dancer’s hands fan outward in geometric vectors, reminiscent of Goncharova’s previous work in a style known as Rayonism, which she invented in Moscow in 1911.

    "tale" : "As the undisputed leader of the Realist movement, Gustave Courbet played a crucial role in the development of modern French painting. But critics and the public did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects; they called him the “apostle of ugliness.” \nThe ample, demurely dressed subject of Mère Grégoire was inspired by the heroine of a popular song written in the 1820s by French lyricist Pierre-Jean Béranger. Béranger often penned ribald lyrics; his “Madame Grégoire” was the proprietor of a house of prostitution. Courbet depicted the woman here in the midst of a transaction, with coins scattered on a marble-topped counter and a ledger beneath her right hand. Under her other hand is the small bell she uses to summon one of her female employees. She presumably offers an unseen customer a flower, a symbol of love. \nThe painting may also have had a political subtext. Béranger and Courbet were fierce opponents of the monarchy and the Second Empire, respectively. In the mid-1850s, when Courbet began his portrait of Mère Grégoire, the government harshly attacked the songs of the popular writer as part of an effort to restrict free expression. Courbet’s decision to portray Béranger’s Madame Grégoire, whose flower exhibits the blue, white, and red of the French flag, may represent a protest not only against government censorship but also against the Second Empire itself, making the subject of this painting into a heroine embodying the rights to freedom in life and love that were forbidden under a repressive regime.",

    "tale" : "In the late 1940s Clyfford Still, along with Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko, originated the type of Abstract Expressionism known as color-field painting, a term used to describe very large canvases dominated by monumental expanses of intense, homogeneous color. Like most of Still’s mature work, Untitled is a sheer wall of paint, imposing and self-sustaining, that makes no concessions to conventional notions of beauty or pictorial illusionism. This painting’s textural effects give it an insistent, complex materiality. Dominated by blacks applied with both a trowel and brushes, the surface is by turns reflective and chalky, granular and smooth, feathery and leaden. These variegated black surfaces are even more emphatic because their continuity is broken by areas of blank canvas and white paint. Like veins in igneous rock, streaks of orange, yellow, and green paint are embedded in the black voids. Mediating between the light and dark masses are areas of crimson, heightened at the edges, as if inflamed, by bright orange.",

    "tale" : "This is a page from the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar), a lavishly illustrated manuscript commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605) to document the history of his rule. The scene depicts the emperor at age thirteen, three days after his accession. Seated on a gold throne placed on a carpeted platform, Akbar watches as his late father’s favorite is arrested for his insolent behavior toward the young emperor. The setting—a tented encampment pitched in a garden—is significant, for Akbar spent much of his reign on the move. Through his active campaigning and strong administrative skills, he greatly expanded the Mughal Empire, consolidating and securing it for his successors. In addition, he was a great patron of the arts, initiating a new style of painting and establishing a vast atelier and library. \nOne of the new themes the emperor encouraged was the painting of historical manuscripts such as the Akbarnama. Commissioned in 1589, it was written by court historian and biographer Abu’l Fazl between 1590 and 1596. Simultaneously, a workshop of about fifty artists illustrated the text. Basawan, the designer of this painting, whose signature appears in the lower margin in red, was one of the studio’s leading painters. He was particularly skilled in portraiture and is known to have painted the faces of the young emperor and the two other figures in front of him: the regent Bairam Khan, who is standing, and the disgraced Shah Abu’l-Ma’ali, who crouches in a red robe. He also painted some of the nearby scenery, which attracted his interest; each painting was collaborative work and could take up to a month to complete.",

    "tale" : "The famous series Eight Views of the Parlor was produced in 1766, around the time of the emergence of full-color prints in Japan. The series contains eight prints that were housed together in a fanciful wrapper, all of which are now in the Art Institute’s collection. These scenes present visual puns based on well-known themes of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers in China, each of which has its own poetic title. For Evening Snow, Suzuki Harunobu depicted silk floss as snow and the floss shaper as the mountain rather than showing snow-covered hills. \nSuch witty visual riddles would have been appreciated by the audience of these prints—wealthy, well-educated townsmen who participated in poetry circles. One such figure was Ōkubo Jinshirō Tadanobu, whose pseudonym was Kyosen. It is thought that he produced this set, engaging Harunobu’s services as well as those of the printer. In fact, this image contains Kyosen’s handwritten signature, leading scholars to believe that the Art Institute’s set is the first edition. Sets with Harunobu’s signature exist in other collections."

In the early 1950s, he began conceiving his sculptures as parts of titled groups, which allowed him to explore multiple permutations of a single theme. Tanktotem is a series in which Smith incorporated boiler parts and cylindrical steel tank parts that he purchased from a catalog.

Her process is intensely time-consuming: molded by hand, each object is cast in plaster, reworked, and cast again, often in polyester or aluminum. The completed forms are then painted with highly saturated, matte, nonreflective colors that create a sense of otherworldliness.

    "tale" : "The painter, sculptor, theorist, filmmaker, and photographer Robert Smithson helped pioneer the Earthwork Movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, which took as its subject the artistic reordering of the American landscape in its many varied forms. Chalk-Mirror Displacement belongs to a series of works, executed in 1968 and 1969, that combine mirrors and organic materials. Eight double-sided mirrors radiate like spokes from the center of a chalk pile located on the gallery floor. As they slice through the pile, the mirrors separate the chalk into almost identical wedge-shaped compartments. The double reflection in each compartment preserves the illusion of the whole pile, making the mirror dividers appear nearly invisible. This work is also one of Smithson’s Site\/Nonsite pieces. The artist referred to the first stage of the work as a “Site Incarnation,” which he created for a particular outdoor location: in this case, a chalk quarry in Oxted, York, England. After setting up and photographing the Site piece, the artist then dismantled it. The materials were subsequently reinstalled in the Nonsite location, the seminal 1969 exhibition When Attitude Becomes Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. This process purposefully blurred the boundaries between art and its environment, within and without gallery walls.",

Although Paris has long been recognized as a great center for ivory carving in the Gothic era, recent scholarship has also emphasized the importance of workshops in England, Germany, and Italy—affirming the popularity of the medium throughout medieval Europe.

A hybrid of photography, film, and installation art, the work projects hundreds of Goldin’s photographs in a unique sequence, accompanied by a specified soundtrack. Images representing couples, gender roles, dependency, and alienation are paired with evocative songs such as Dean Martin’s “Memories Are Made of This.” It is appropriate that images of her subjects’ fantasies and sorrows should be realized as short-lived projections. The slide projector was adopted as an artistic vehicle in the 1960s and 1970s for public performance-based work, and The Ballad codifies more performative presentations by the artist in the clubs and cinemas of 1980s New York’s artistic demimonde. \nGoldin’s pictures, like images of family vacations or holidays, embrace photography’s potential for immediacy, emotion, and anecdote. Unlike such snapshots, however, they capture Goldin, her friends, and her family in moments of intimacy—lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization—and depict the rollercoaster of human emotions that accompanies these moments. In this way, The Ballad offers a more exposed, and potentially more honest, version of the traditional domestic slideshow.",

    "tale" : "Just two years before she received her first camera, Diane Arbus wrote: “There are and have been and will be an infinite number of things on Earth. Individuals all different, all wanting different things, all knowing different things, all loving different things, all looking different… . That is what I love: the differentness.” Arbus’s appreciation for the unusual, eccentric, and extraordinary led her to photograph a range of subjects over the thirty years of her career—transvestites, giants, art philanthropists, nudists, and, as here, similarly dressed and made-up women. These ladies, with their cigarettes poised in one hand and lighters clutched in the other, occupy a booth in a New York City automat. (Now nearly obsolete and a nostalgic choice even in the 1960s, automats offered simple fare, sold from coin-operated vending machines, that was eaten at surrounding booths and counters.) Like many of Arbus’s subjects, these women were photographed in a straightforward manner. The eerily matched ladies face the camera head-on, posed in front of an unadorned marble wall and staring directly at the viewer. The candor with which Arbus presented these women is typical of the pioneering, powerful first-person directness that exists throughout her photography."

    "tale" : "In the mid-1960s Vija Celmins began using photographs from books, magazines, and newspapers that she found in secondhand stores and at yard sales as the point of departure for her paintings. While she produced work in the wake of Pop Art, her interest in the quotidian had nothing to do with issues of commerce or the media but rather with the illusionistic process of image making itself. Since the early 1970s, the artist has created exacting depictions of such expansive subjects as desert floors, ocean waves, the surface of the moon, and star-studded night skies—the latter derived from satellite photographs. To create her smooth, velvety compositions, Celmins often applies multiple layers of pigment to her canvases, sanding each down before she adds the next. Each work is further modulated through the use of a wide range of black, white, and silvery-gray tones. With its jewel-like imagery and suggestion of vastness, Night Sky #2 is at once romantic and unsettling. Lacking the anchor of a horizon, a humanly scaled reference point, or a recognizable landmark, viewers may have difficulty determining their relationship to the image. The enormity of the subject presented on a relatively small scale (the work is less than two feet wide) furthers this sense of disorientation.",

    "tale" : "John Storrs was a leading American modernist sculptor in the 1920s and 1930s. Although he moved to Paris in 1911 and spent much of his career there, he grew up in Chicago and studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Ceres is a smaller version of the figure Storrs designed for the top of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In his efforts to make the sculpture symbolic of the building’s purpose, Storrs turned to the Classical subject of Ceres, the Roman goddess of grain, alluding to the board’s activity as the world’s biggest grain exchange. He depicted Ceres holding a sheaf of wheat in one hand and a grain sample bag in the other. Storrs also synchronized his sculpture with the building’s Art Deco architecture, emphasizing the figure’s streamlined form and employing modern materials. Ceres garnered a great deal of praise; a contemporary review stated that “this work has been described by some of the nation’s leading architects as one of the finest pieces of architectural sculpture to be found in America.” Perhaps in reaction to such favorable notices, Storrs produced smaller versions of the sculpture, such as this one.",

    "tale" : "Lawrence Weiner established himself as one of the leading figures in the Conceptual Art Movement during the late 1960s by creating works that challenge traditional assumptions about the nature of the art object. Using language as his medium, Weiner set out to question the conventional relationship between artist and viewer and to redefine standard systems of artistic display and distribution. In 1968 he issued a statement of intent, outlining the three conditions in which his works could exist: they could be built by him; fabricated by someone else; or not constructed at all. His works have the potential for being realized in countless ways and contexts; they may be shown outdoors as a public project, published in a book, printed on a matchbook cover, or simply spoken. He is best known, however, for written phrases presented on gallery or museum walls, typically in stenciled or vinyl lettering. Weiner felt the permanence and integrity of a linguistic construction, presented as a title in the form of a simple descriptive phrase on the wall, was less vulnerable to change over time than an actual sculpture. This work—which describes a physical act of displacement as a metaphor for representation—and its title are one and the same."

    "tale" : "This masterpiece of Renaissance relief sculpture by the Venetian artist Alessandro Vittoria was commissioned in 1580 by Hans Fugger, a member of a noted Augsburg banking family, to decorate an altarpiece for the chapel of his family’s castle in Kirchheim, Swabia. Here Vittoria translated into bronze the ﬂickering light and colorful palette of the great Venetian painters of the period; his composition is specifically adapted from altarpieces by Titian. Working in wax (from which the finished relief was then cast in bronze), Vittoria manipulated the relief’s form and edges to catch the light. The result is a highly animated surface in which everything—figures, drapery, clouds, and sky—seems to move with excitement, heightening the drama between the sharply turned, startled Virgin and the powerful figure of Gabriel, who has suddenly descended from heaven to announce that she will be the mother of Christ. Fully sculpted in the round, the archangel’s arm points to the smallest feature in the scene: the dove, representing the Holy Ghost of the Christian Trinity. The plasticity and depth of the relief, the dramatic movement, and the handling of detail make this one of the artist’s finest creations.",

    "tale" : "As this monumental cauldron demonstrates, the most distinctive bronze vessels of early China represent important historical documents as well as stunningly powerful works of art. Designed to contain offerings of meat in ritual ceremonies, this vessel was cast with a lengthy inscription on its interior bowl. The text commemorates a solemn ritual ceremony at the imperial court of the Zhou, the second dynasty recorded in Chinese texts, and explains that Captain Wang, a noble official who had been rewarded for his loyal service to the Zhou king, commissioned this vessel to honor his deceased father and record the occasion for succeeding generations. Together with the inscription, the vessel’s shallow profile and austere surface decor date it to the early ninth century BC. Although the monsterlike masks that project from each leg display animal imagery common on older bronzes, the two registers of hooked, ribbonlike bands that encircle the bowl preserve only traces of early dragon or bird patterns. The transition from zoomorphic to abstract surface designs marks a significant turning point in the art of early Chinese bronzes. Recent archaeological discoveries of similar bronze vessels in China indicate that this cauldron was most likely buried as part of a large hoard.",

    "tale" : "The ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan was once the largest city in all of the Americas. The pomp and color of this great city were expressed most distinctively through its monumental architecture. Facades of pyramids and interiors of palaces, temples, and homes were frequently decorated with splendid frescoes. The fragment shown here was part of a cycle painted on the interior walls of an aristocratic palace. It shows a rain priest walking or dancing in profile and wearing an elaborate headdress and costume. His speech-scroll, adorned with seashells and plants, indicates that he is praying for water and agricultural prosperity, which were highly valued in his society. \nMeaning “place of the gods,” Teotihuacan was the largest religious, military, and trading city in the Americas between A.D. 200 and 650, and it was inhabited by over one hundred thousand people at its peak. Designed with colossal pyramids and ritual plazas, the metropolis was built on a cosmologically oriented grid plan that embraced residential and manufacturing districts. This richly symbolic fragment from a Teotihuacan wall fresco depicts a ceremony that took place once every fifty-two years, a “century” in the ancient Mexican calendar system. A priest stands before a tied bundle of reeds representing the completion of a cycle of time. The bundle is impaled by the spiny points of maguey cactus leaves, with which the priestly protagonist of the scene has pricked himself to provide a blood offering. Water symbols in the form of shells and flowers are depicted within the speech-scroll curling from the priest’s mouth. Additional flowers and water are sprinkled from one of the priest’s hands, while in the other he holds an incense bag. Corresponding to the chants of a religious litany, this complex image was repeated with others on the walls of a chamber as a prayer of thanksgiving and for the renewal of agricultural fertility.",

In Still Life with Geranium, he transformed a simple still life into a populated Arcadian landscape painting, rendered in the brilliant color, thick paint, and rapid brushwork characteristic of the group of painters known as the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). Matisse was recognized by critics as the leader of this group. \nThis composition is one of contrasts—the pale palette and light brushwork in the upper half of the picture are juxtaposed with the darker colored, heavily painted lower half; the firmly planted pose of the female figure is contraposed with the almost-ﬂeeing figure of the male; and the red vegetables grown near Paris are set near ceramic objects from exotic, faraway places. One of many still-life paintings in which Matisse incorporated his own figurative sculptures, here the artist challenged his viewers’ expectations by rendering his modeled figures with minimal color and simple lines. Probably represented as plaster casts, these figures would later be made in bronze editions by the artist; versions of Woman Leaning on Her Hands (on the right of the geranium) and Thorn Extractor (on the left) are also in the collection of the Art Institute."

In 1894 he turned his skill and energy to sculpture. This vigorous portrayal of a cowboy taming a wild horse was the artist’s first effort in bronze, and with an illustrator’s eye for drama, he captured the single most illuminating moment of the event. Although the horse and rider struggle against each other, they are pulled together at the instant of utmost exertion. As the bronco rears up, back arched and splayed tail snapping, the cowboy leans forward, his whip suspended in midair as he clutches the reins and horse’s mane. This minutely rendered, spirited, and technically remarkable depiction of life in the West became one of the most popular American bronzes of the early twentieth century. The Art Institute’s version is one of nearly seventy made at the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company of New York using the French sand-casting method.",

    "tale" : "Roy Lichtenstein was perhaps the most consistently inventive artist among the group of individuals who rose to prominence as the progenitors of American Pop Art in the early 1960s. Throughout his career, he explored the functional simplicity and visual clichés that characterize processes of mechanical reproduction. Initially preoccupied with the visual immediacy of cartoons, Lichtenstein embraced the technical constraints of graphic illustration, applying them to painting. Mirror #3 (Six Panels) is among the most ambitious, summarizing canvases in the artist’s Mirror series (1969–72). Like his famous cartoon images, these paintings were inspired by popular culture sources. Studying illustrations from furniture and glass-company catalogues, Lichtenstein familiarized himself with pictorial conventions used to represent reflection. The work also references the long tradition of rendering mirrors in art, a theme that was explored by artists from Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso. Lichtenstein was perhaps most invested, however, in broadly generic questions of surface and support. Only stylized gleam and shadow are reflected in his mirror; thus, the puzzling, fragmented, even conceptual abstraction becomes the real subject of the work.",

He settled in Brussels, where he was named official city painter in 1436 and maintained a busy workshop. He executed altarpieces and portraits for religious institutions, court functionaries, and the powerful dukes of the Burgundian Netherlands. \nThe coat of arms, motto, and personal device of a pulley painted on the back of the Art Institute’s portrait identify the subject of this painting as Jean Gros, an official of the Burgundian court. This portrait depicts him at the outset of a successful career, during which he amassed a large fortune and led a privileged life. Rogier presented the half-length figure against a plain, dark background, which accentuates the sitter’s features and the prayerful gesture of his expressive hands. This gesture indicates that the panel was once part of a diptych, a folding, portable altarpiece used for private devotion: Gros’s devout, abstracted gaze was in fact directed at another panel bearing the image of the Madonna and Child (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tournai). Gros’s coat of arms is on the back of that panel as well. \nThis type of diptych, which was intended to suggest continuous prayer and to record the donor’s features, was probably first made for princes around 1400, but Rogier revitalized the form, giving a striking focus and elegance to examples he produced for members of the Burgundian court.",

    "tale" : "In this dazzling royal procession, Maharana Bhim Singh (r. 1778-1828) rides across his kingdom, Mewar, on horseback. Richly bejeweled and tattooed, with his horse’s reins in one hand and a hookah mouthpiece in the other, Bhim Singh deftly projects an image of power combined with pleasure and comfort. The leashed cheetah and falcon seem to be merely part of the large entourage arrayed around the ruler, which also contains men bearing royal standards and insignia, including a black solar disk with a gold sun in the center, a symbol of the once-proud Sisodia clan of Mewar. \nThe magnificence of the scene belies the fact that Bhim Singh was actually a weak ruler in a succession of ineffectual leaders. Mewar had once been considered the strongest Rajput state because of its lengthy resistance to the Mughal emperors, but in 1818 Bhim Singh was forced to sign a treatey with the British, accepting their protection.",

    "tale" : "In 1912 Arthur Dove made news when he exhibited in New York and Chicago ten pastels that were the first abstract works by an American to be seen by the public. Beginning with themes from nature, Dove had simplified and rearranged them, creating patterns, rhythms, and color harmonies that demonstrated how artists could dispense with representational subjects in order to communicate through form and color alone. From then on, Dove dedicated himself to exploring how he might depart from illusionism without abandoning nature. \nSilver Sun reveals with particular clarity Dove’s method of recasting nature into art. The artist’s sense of wonder at the force and beauty of the world is apparent, but so is his control over his creative means and, ultimately, over our aesthetic experience. Dove imparted a metaphysical radiance through expanding rings of blue and green, and through his use of glowing metallic-silver paint. He simplified, adjusted, and accented the landscape until the pulsating image no longer represented the thing seen but rather conveyed feeling, impact, and meaning. \nDove remained committed to a personal vision. Nevertheless, he was well informed about current trends, and a web of interconnections links his work to that of others. For example, Silver Sun relates to the art of two of Dove’s friends, the painter Georgia O’Keeffe (see p. 116) and the photographer Alfred Stieglitz: they, like Dove, sometimes depicted transcendent skies in order to communicate a vision of the wholeness of nature.",

For his Catenary series (1997–2003), of which Near the Lagoon is the largest and last work, Johns formed catenaries—a term used to describe the curve assumed by a cord suspended freely from two points—by tacking ordinary household string to the canvas or its supports. In Near the Lagoon, the string activates and engages the abstract, collaged field of multitonal gray behind it, casting an actual shadow on the canvas, in addition to the painted ones that Johns rendered by hand; the string even creates a rut where the artist embedded it into and later pulled it out of the encaustic.",

Poetic mélanges of found objects and materials, his deeply personal and elusive work (which also includes many collages on paper) combines the enthusiasms of his childhood—butterflies, marbles, seashells, sky charts, stamps—with adult fascinations such as ballerinas, empty cages, and movie stars. Cornell’s boxes often prompt a dizzying series of associations; in Untitled (Butterfly Habitat), these include Christmas decorations, collector’s cabinets for specimens, microscopes, natural history displays, sailor’s boxes, and windows. Some of these references are contradictory, reinforcing the work’s ambiguity. Ideas linked to flight, voyages, and the exotic are countered by the rigid and symmetrical organization of the display. The butterflies are not, however, pinned as they would be on a specimen board. Each pane of paint-spattered glass encloses a small compartment with white wood walls in which a cutout of a paper butterfly is suspended with string, allowing for some movement as the box is handled.",

    "tale" : "A leader among the nation’s second generation of sculptors, John Quincy Adams Ward played a significant role in elevating the medium in the United States, calling for a new realism to address moral concerns. Inspired by Abraham Lincoln’s 1862–63 Emancipation Proclamation, The Freedman reflects not only Ward’s aspiration to create relevant statements on pressing issues of the day but also his abolitionist sentiments. Using antiquity as his inspiration, he depicted a seminude man seated on a tree stump who has just been liberated from the shackles that bound him to slavery. Ward broke artistic convention by showing the former enslaved person as master of his own destiny, not a man reliant on white men for freedom. The vestiges of chains, potent symbols of his bondage, dangle from both wrists, and his muscular body, turned to look over his shoulder, is contained within a formal, triangular composition. The Freedman was modeled from life and is generally considered among the first naturalistic sculptural representations of an African American. Shortly after The Freedman was first exhibited in 1863, art critic James Jackson Jarves effectively summarized the work’s power: “We have seen nothing in our sculpture more soul-lifting or more comprehensively eloquent. It tells in one word the whole sad story of slavery and the bright story of emancipation.”",

    "tale" : "This imposing head probably comes from a full-length sculpture of an apostle that was one of the column or jamb figures flanking the portals of the west facade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Showing the heritage of ancient and Byzantine models, it bears all the stylistic hallmarks of the beginning of the Gothic style in the region around the year 1200. The object’s origin was the subject of heated scholarly debate for several decades. Neutron activation analysis has shown that the limestone came from a quarry that also supplied stone for other carvings on Notre-Dame. The discovery of sculptural fragments from the cathedral’s Gallery of Kings above the west portals, dated to between 1220 and 1235 (and now in the Musée National du Moyen Âge, Paris), provided an important point of comparison. The Art Institute’s head is said to have been found during excavations for the modernization of Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. Medieval sculpture from Notre-Dame was purposefully damaged in the 1790s during the French Revolution because of its presumed royal associations. Fragments of some of the sculpture removed at the order of the revolutionary tribunal were buried out of a lingering respect for its tradition and quality, to be rediscovered in later years.",

While executing a commission from Empress Josephine of France for a full-length statue of Paris (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Canova carved this bust for his friend Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, a French Neoclassical theorist and critic who greatly inﬂuenced the sculptor’s artistic ideals. It depicts the moment in Greek mythology when the shepherd Paris, called upon by Zeus to judge who was the most beautiful among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, turns to gaze at the three goddesses. Canova exploited the subject to create an ideal head, balancing the geometry of pure forms with the sensuousness of Paris’s expression. Upon receipt of the gift, Quatremère stated: “There is in [the bust] a mixture of the heroic and the voluptuous, the noble and the amorous. I do not believe that in any other work you have ever combined such life, softness, and chaste purity.” Documents indicate that Canova made four full-length marble statues and at least seven busts of Paris, a clear indication of the sculpture’s popularity.",

    "tale" : "Considered one of the most original and innovative Italian artists of the Baroque period, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione literally separated light from darkness, creating form out of chaos in this work, his earliest known monotype. In a perfect match of medium and message, Castiglione, the Genoese artist credited with inventing the technique, used this new method to portray the central act of Genesis: the creation of man. He produced this electrifying image by subtracting the design from the inked surface of a copperplate with a blunt instrument, such as a stick or paintbrush handle, and then printing directly on a sheet of paper. Broad, angular strokes of white depict God emerging from a cloud, while thin, fluid lines extract the languid body of Adam from velvety blackness. Castiglione’s monotypes employ both this dark-ground technique, which naturally lends itself to dramatic and mysterious imagery, and the light-ground manner, in which the design is drawn in ink directly on a clean plate. Both processes yield only one fine impression. It was not until the nineteenth century that such versatile artists as Edgar Degas explored the monotype’s full potential.",

Around 1728 Augustus conceived of replicating the animal kingdom in porcelain for display in a Baroque palace that he was transforming into a showcase for his collections of Asian and Meissen ceramics. This porcelain zoo was intended for the long gallery on the main floor of the palace. By 1733, the year the king died, more than thirty different models of birds and almost forty animals had been made, many by the sculptor Johann Joachim Kändler, who worked at Meissen from 1731 to 1775. Kändler drew this vulture from life, which allowed him to animate his work with the creature’s quintessential spirit. Such porcelain animals remain the most vivid expression of Augustus’s wish, as elector and king, to possess and rule over the natural world.",

    "tale" : "“The eyes of the Armenian speak before the lips move and long after they cease to,” Arshile Gorky once wrote. These words aptly describe this heroic portrait of the artist’s mother, Shushan der Marderosian. Although of noble lineage, Shushan and her family were peasants who faced poverty and Turkish persecution and massacre; in 1919 she died from starvation. The following year, Gorky and one of his sisters immigrated to the United States. This tender, haunting image is based on a photograph of the artist with his mother taken in 1912. Clad in simple country clothes, Shushan is a gaunt, distant figure with remarkable and piercing eyes. Gorky depicted his mother with careful, classical simplicity, transforming her dark beauty into the perfect features of an Orthodox church icon. The same photograph served as the inspiration for two canvases entitled The Artist and His Mother (1926–c. 1936; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; c. 1926–c. 1942; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), as well as numerous notebook sketches and other drawings, of which this is the most finished. From this early representational mode, Gorky’s art underwent a complex evolution that led, in the 1940s, to his dynamic, biomorphic abstractions. Tragically, the artist did not escape hardship. After a series of personal disasters in the 1940s, Gorky took his own life.",

    "tale" : "This vast landscape by one of the central figures of German Romanticism dates from Caspar David Friedrich’s early years in Dresden, where he settled after studying in Copenhagen (then considered the artistic center of northern Europe). Subtly graded shades of gray wash evoke the gloomy, overcast days so common in Germany in November, when this image was created. The drawing also conveys, in the artist’s words, “Not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him.” In the center of the landscape, atop the highest peak, a tiny pilgrim kneels in prayer at the base of a statue of the Madonna. Nature—with its sheer, blank sky, stark hills, and mute firs—is depicted almost religiously. In this deeply spiritual image, humankind’s experience of nature seems as overwhelming as the unfathomable mystery of our existence. Just as the infinitesimal pilgrim wanders in this faraway, expansive landscape, so too did the artist embark upon his own Romantic quest, a search for meaning in the natural world that reveals the sacred."

    "tale" : "Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s work is consistently characterized by a sense of quiet elegy. One of the defining moments in his widely influential career, “Untitled” can be considered a self-portrait in the form of words and dates. First realized in 1989, the work expanded with subsequent installations until the artist’s premature death in 1996, and can continue to shift in ongoing manifestations. The portrait joins historical events and enigmatic personal milestones into a running text placed close to the ceiling. Such an installation is reminiscent of traditional friezes carved on the faces of public architecture, including the facade of the Art Institute’s 1893 Allerton Building, which includes artists’ names chiseled into a horizontal band. By offering clues to a personal history in a commemorative form normally dedicated to institutional use, Gonzalez-Torres undercuts the public and official in favor of the private and subjective, reminding us that an individual’s identity is not always reducible to an image captured on canvas or etched in marble. “Untitled” can change each time it is installed and may be presented in an infinite variety of ways. Its owner is obliged to consider adding (or subtracting) events, including ones subsequent to the artist’s death, ensuring that it remains relevant and dynamic.",

    "tale" : "A pioneer of Abstract Expressionism, Willem de Kooning experimented with the human form throughout his career, which reached its apex in the early 1950s with his celebrated Woman series. Two Women’s Torsos was created during an intense campaign in which the artist focused on drawings related to his Woman paintings, which were exhibited together with this and other drawings at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, in 1953. \nDe Kooning’s drawings are admired for their number and variety as well as for the artist’s expressive technique, exemplified here by his gestural use of pastel in concert with charcoal. This drawing’s velvety texture and almost violently animated surface are characteristic of the approximately one hundred sheets that remain from his intense work on the woman theme in 1952 and 1953. Also typical of de Kooning’s art is the way in which Two Women’s Torsos references aspects of related paintings but stands alone as an independent work. As the artist tried to jettison traditional modes of composition, he used drawing as a primary vehicle for the sequential development of his most important early body of work.",

    "tale" : "In Hyères, France, Henri Cartier-Bresson captured the instant when an ever-moving image—in this case, a bicyclist streaking by an iron railing—achieves a timeless harmony of form, expression, and content. An early work, taken before Cartier-Bresson was a professional photographer, this picture of the world in flux shows spontaneity, intuition, and a Surrealist whimsy. Cartier-Bresson’s keen sense of composition derived, in part, from his training as a painter, as well as an acknowledged indebtedness to André Kertész. Both photographers used a miniature Leica camera, which allowed for thirty-six exposures in quick succession and, because of its compact serviceability, acted as a true extension of the eye. So definite was Cartier-Bresson’s rapid-fire release of the shutter that he used the entire negative of the final print, unretouched and unmanipulated. This remarkable capacity to seize life’s calculated and coincidental ambiguities explains why his is one of the most influential visions of the twentieth century. In addition to his later celebrated photojournalistic works, Cartier-Bresson produced two films, published more than a dozen books, and in 1947 helped establish the collaborative photography agency Magnum.",

As Song poets and painters praised incense for its efficacy in dissipating gloom and stimulating artistic creativity, connoisseurs treasured its accoutrements as luxurious domestic furnishings.

    "tale" : "The Art Institute acquired The Two Disciples at the Tomb in 1906 after the canvas was declared “the most impressive and distinguished work of the season” at the museum’s annual exhibition of American painting and sculpture. At that time, Henry Ossawa Tanner was at the height of his reputation, enjoying international fame and winning prizes on both sides of the Atlantic. The son of an African American bishop, Tanner was raised in Philadelphia, where he studied with Thomas Eakins before working as an artist and photographer in Atlanta. Repelled by the racial prejudice he encountered in the United States, he chose to spend nearly all of his adult life in France. \nTanner’s early subjects included many scenes of African American life, but later he specialized in religious paintings. The Two Disciples at the Tomb is one of the most concentrated and austere of these works. The somber spirituality of the moment when two of Jesus’s followers realize that he has risen from the dead is conveyed by Tanner’s use of dark tones and compressed space and his avoidance of superfluous detail. Although the artist painted in a relatively conservative representational manner throughout his life, the sinuous lines and simplified, harsh modeling here suggest his awareness of Art Nouveau and Expressionist currents in contemporary European painting. Likewise, his emphasis on psychological rather than physical experience has many parallels in advanced art of the same period, including Pablo Picasso’s early work, such as The Old Guitarist, painted two years earlier.",

    "tale" : "Among his many recollections of childhood, Max Ernst often recounted his fear and fascination with the forest that surrounded his home. He wrote of feeling “delight and oppression and what the Romantics called ‘emotion in the face of Nature.’” By expressing his thoughts in these terms, Ernst linked himself with the spiritual landscape tradition of Romanticism, which conceived of an invisible realm at work in the natural world. \nThis dark and mysterious forest scene dates to one of the most creative periods of Ernst’s career. Spurred by the Surrealist leader André Breton’s proclamation of “pure psychic automatism” as an artistic ideal, he developed the innovative technique of frottage, his term for the method of reproducing a relief design (like the surface of a piece of wood) by laying paper or canvas over it and rubbing it with a pencil, charcoal, or another medium. In Forest and Sun Ernst used this technique to create a petrified forest, which he imbued with a sense of primordial otherworldliness. By scraping away almost-dry paint on the canvas (a process he called grattage), the artist produced the encircled sun at the center of the composition. Ernst painted six variations of the forest and sun theme. As in the other five canvases, the tree trunks suggest a letter in the artist’s name: in this case, a capital M.",

In this portrait, Sir Joshua Reynolds—the first president of the Royal Academy and a champion of the importance of classical artistic models—conferred upon her a ﬂattering honorary citizenship in the ancient world. Dressed in a loose, vaguely Roman costume and surrounded by the art and artifacts of antiquity, Lady Sarah is cast as a devotee of the Three Graces, symbols of generosity and the mythical companions of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Lady Sarah pours a libation into a smoking tripod, and one of the Graces seems to offer her a wreath, as if inviting the aristocratic beauty to join their number. As an academician, Reynolds valued historical subjects, but as a practicing painter, he made his living largely through portraiture. In this and other grand portraits, he found a way of combining the requirements of his patrons with the prestige of the classical tradition.",

    "tale" : "The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan is among Eugène Delacroix’s finest early representations of battle. The painting was inspired by The Giaour, a lengthy poem by England’s famous Romantic poet, Lord Byron. Written in 1813 and translated into French in 1824, the poem presents a subject and setting—passion avenged on a Greek battlefield—that perfectly suited the artist’s Romantic imagination. The painting depicts the poem’s dramatic climax, when the Venetian giaour (a Turkish word for a non-Muslim) avenges his lover’s death at the hands of the Turk Hassan. Weapons poised, the two enemies face off in mirroring poses: the giaour in swirling white, and Hassan with his face hidden. With its exotic costumes, intense drama, and forceful colors and forms, this painting is the most revered of the six known versions Delacroix made based on Byron’s poem. Begun in 1824, the year Byron died in the struggle for Greek independence from the Turks, Delacroix finished the painting two years later, just in time for it to be included in a Parisian exhibition benefiting the popular Greek cause.",

A shepherd and his ﬂock are dwarfed by the ruins of a castle, a massive hill in the background, and dark, swollen clouds gathering overhead. Ruisdael’s skillful use of color also enhances the painting’s poetic effect. Other than the glowing terra-cotta of the ruins and the restrained use of creamy whites, his palette consists mostly of the greens and browns of nature. There is only one small point of bright color in the entire painting: the shepherd’s red jacket. Although the artist’s choice of ruins as his subject followed an established pictorial tradition in the Netherlands, he was not concerned with topographical accuracy; indeed, the prominent hill behind the structure was a product of his imagination. The castle, once the seat of the Counts of Egmond, had powerful associations. It was destroyed at the command of the Prince of Orange to prevent the Spanish Army from occupying it during the Dutch struggle for independence from Spanish rule in the late sixteenth century.",

    "tale" : "Corpus of Christ was originally the focal point of a large triptych combining painting and sculpture that was commissioned in 1390 by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, for the newly founded Charterhouse of Champol outside Dijon. Philip intended this monastery as a dynastic burial place, and he and his successors endowed it with artistic treasures. The triptych was a collaboration between two important artists from the Flemish territories controlled by Philip the Bold: the sculptor Jacques de Baerze and the painter Melchior Broederlam. When open, the altarpiece showed carved reliefs of the Crucifixion, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Entombment together with standing figures of saints. The gilded center could be covered by movable wings whose backs, painted with scenes from the Infancy of Christ by Broederlam, were visible when the altarpiece was closed. The triptych still survives in Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), but the central figure of the crucified Christ was removed during the French Revolution. Even separated from its context within the altarpiece, however, the crucified Christ remains a powerfully expressive work. Christ’s tensed hands and feet and earthy features are realistically observed, while the curving contour of his torso and the folds of his loincloth reflect a more courtly ideal.",

    "tale" : "Pop Art icon Andy Warhol’s embrace of mass culture radically altered the course of late twentieth-century art history, redefining both what a work of art can or should depict as well as the way in which it can be made. His breakthrough artistic moment came when he took the commercial printing process of photo-emulsion silkscreen and applied it to canvas. This allowed him to reproduce the same image over and over, quickly and efficiently. \nWarhol celebrated both products and personalities, giving equal weight to soup cans and movie stars. He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming Cleopatra (1963). Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz] comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar. This garish use of “makeup” is meant to suggest style and glamor, reinforcing Taylor’s celebrity status.",

Gutai (“concreteness” in Japanese) was formed in 1954 and swiftly became postwar Japan’s most significant avant-garde collective. In its manifesto the group advocated for an exuberant, ethically invested freedom of expression: “Gutai Art imparts life to matter.” \nShiraga once described the world as a “splendid playground.” He sought an unmediated form of painting, soon abandoning the traditional brush in order to paint with his feet, swinging himself from ropes over sheets of paper placed on the floor. The earliest of these pioneering works were made as part of live performances, but from 1959 Shiraga continued his practice on canvas and within his studio. This 1960 painting demonstrates the range of simultaneously sensuous and dynamic effects the artist could achieve through his singular method — slick, muscular smears of brighter and darker reds and oranges contrast with vigorous insertions of deep blue as well as with a fringe of more atmospheric stains of color. The title refers to the celebrated fourteenth-century Chinese novel Shuihu zhuan (Water Margin), which follows the feats of outlaw Song Jiang and his band of accomplices.",

July or August, at eight or nine o’clock, after a slight shower during the night.” To achieve the effect of sparkling wetness and a freshness of earth and air, Constable painted as much with a palette knife as with a brush, ﬂecking the surface with white highlights and sketching and scraping the picture into existence. The deliberate ruggedness of his style echoes nature’s rough spontaneity. The unpolished execution is reminiscent of the full-scale sketches in oil that Con-stable made for earlier exhibition paintings; however, no more fully treated version is known, and the rich color suggests that this is a finished work, done in the artist’s late style. Constable’s emphasis on surface brushwork and texture in his effort to record the constantly shifting effects of natural light on land and sky exerted enor-mous inﬂuence on French artists like Eugène Delacroix and a younger generation of French painters, the Impressionists.",

    "tale" : "Fernand Léger first saw the work of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at the Paris gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Around 1909 Léger began to paint in a Cubist style, although his compositions in this mode are more colorful and curvilinear than works by Braque and Picasso of the same period, with their angular forms and subdued tones. An artist with far-ranging interests and talents, Léger later became a designer for theater, opera, and ballet, as well as a book illustrator, filmmaker, muralist, ceramist, and teacher.Typically, Léger would develop a major composition by preparing studies in a variety of media. The Railway Crossing is an oil study for The Level Crossing (1919; private collection, Basel, Switzerland). When he took up this subjectin 1919, he made a number of drawings and oil sketches, including the present work. Like many of his contemporaries, Léger was fascinated by the machine age. He maintained that machines and industrial objects were as important to his art as figures. References to such elements pervade The Railway Crossing. In the midst of a complex scaffolding of cylinders and beams, an arrow appears on a brightly outlined signboard. A network of solid volumes and flat forms seems to circulate within the shallow space, just as pistons move within a motor. The precise definition of his forms and the brilliance of his palette express Léger’s belief that the machine, along with the age it created, was one of the triumphs of modern civilization. \n— Entry, Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013, p. 118. \n Like \n Robert Delaunay’s\nChamps de Mars: The Red Tower of 1911, Fernand Léger’s \nThe Railway Crossing (Preliminary Version) is a paean to modernity, its dynamism, energy, and movement. Unlike Delaunay’s earlier work, however, this painting contains no specifically recognizable objects, except the directional sign with the arrow. Rather than a representation of a rail-road crossing, Léger created a new kind of visual poetry from the fragments, colors, and shapes of his environment, evoking the rich sensations elicited by modern industrialized life. Tubular beams appear to intersect the surface, evoking both the pistons of a machine and the open, metal structures used in modern construction. Other forms, such as the circular, target-like shape on the left, the stripes that proliferate throughout the painting, and most obviously the directional sign with the arrow, seem to have been inspired by the colorful, simplified geometry of road signs or the loud, attention-getting designs of billboards and posters. In this respect, Léger prefigured the later fascination of Pop artists with these elements of modern life. The railroad crossing, a subject epitomizing the noisy mechanical world that Léger loved, had first been painted by the artist as early as 1912. In 1919, he resumed portraying this subject, making a number of drawings and oil sketches, including our own, in preparation for a much larger, finished painting. The Art Institute version already contains the major compositional elements found in the final work. There is, however, one dramatic difference: for the final painting, Léger decided to turn the entire composition upside down, in what amounts to a declaration of the painting’s complete autonomy from representation. \n—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 156-157.",

    "tale" : "When the dreaded bandit El Maragato was seized in 1806 by the humble monk Pedro de Zaldivia, a lay brother of a Franciscan barefoot order, the story swept through Spain. Not only did daily newspapers and pamphlets publicize it, but songs, ballads, and popular prints also praised the heroic deed. Although Francisco de Goya was chief painter to the Spanish king at the time, he was interested in the whole range of human experience, including contemporary Spanish events. The tale of Zaldivia and Maragato evidently captured his imagination. This small, lively painting belongs to a series of six in the Art Institute, which, like a modern-day comic strip, dramatically illustrates the event. This is the climactic scene, presenting the bandit’s humiliating and somewhat comical downfall at the hands of the brave monk. Here, as in all the panels, the artist’s broad, quick brushwork dispenses with unnecessary detail to pinpoint the essential drama of the event. Goya may have made these paintings for himself rather than for a commission, since they were still listed among his possessions in an 1812 inventory.",

    "tale" : "Auguste Rodin’s powerfully expressive figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve, flanking a sculptured bronze portal commissioned by the French government for the Musée de Arts Décoratifs, Paris. For this monumental undertaking, which he entitled The Gates of Hell, Rodin turned to past Italian masters. Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508–12) inspired the pose of Rodin’s subject. Rodin rotated Michelangelo’s reclining Adam and transferred the frescoed figure’s gesture of receiving life from God to the sculpture’s right arm. The exaggerated turn of Adam’s left arm comes from Michelangelo’s sculpture of the dead Christ in his Pietà (1548–55; Museo del Duomo, Florence). Rodin chose the portal’s theme from Dante’s fourteenth-century epic poem Inferno; here Adam’s agonized body strikingly conveys the sufferings caused by original sin. Although the museum building was never constructed and the portal was not completed as originally conceived, Rodin explored the expressive potential of the human body as few artists before him had dared. As independent statues, Adam and Eve are among the commission’s numerous progeny. Not until 1938 was the gate cast in bronze and placed at the entrance to the grounds of the Musée Rodin, Paris.",

    "tale" : "The son of German immigrants, Lyonel Feininger was born in New York and moved to Germany in 1887. By the 1890s, he had become an accomplished cartoonist (his series Wee Willie Winkie’s World and Kin-der-Kids ran for years in many newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune). Feininger began to paint in 1907 and quickly became associated with the German Expressionists. He taught at the famed art school the Bauhaus until the Nazis closed it in 1933; four years later, he left Germany for the United States.Feininger’s 1911 Carnival in Arcueil is important not only for the considerable skill it exhibits but also for the way it combines past and future interests of the artist. Feininger spent several months each year in the French city of Arcueil. Depicting its famed Roman viaduct soaring over a row of tall, narrow houses, the composition reveals a fascination with architectural forms that would continue throughout the artist’s life. Against this expressive, colorful backdrop, Feininger set a scene of revelry. With their elongated and angular bodies, whimsical costumes, and antic behavior, the fantastic characters in the foreground—like the toy figures and houses Feininger fashioned at the same time—are rooted in the artist’s cartooning, in which he was then still involved. While his subsequent work retains the elegance of draftsmanship and keen sense of observation he developed as a cartoonist, Feininger became increasingly committed to expressing universal and spiritual ideas in the color-saturated meditations on architecture, landscapes, and sea scenes for which he is now best known.—Entry, Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013, p.106.This is one of a group of recently rediscovered early masterpieces by Lyonel Feininger that had been left behind when the artist and his family were forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1937 for the United States. For over forty years, this group of roughly fifty pictures remained unknown and inaccessible in the East German home of the friend in whose custody Feininger had left them. Only after a prolonged legal battle were all but three of the pictures finally returned to the artist’s heirs in 1984 and exhibited as a group in 1985.This picture reveals an artist of remarkable maturity and vision, despite the fact that Feininger had not turned seriously to painting until 1907. It was only then that improved financial circumstances allowed him to give up his successful career as a cartoonist. The setting for this painting is the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Its majestic viaduct became a frequent subject in the artist’s drawings starting as early as 1908. His intense interest in architecture, which was to remain constant in Feininger’s work, is apparent here not only in the use of the viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored block of houses in the middle ground. It may have been reinforced at this time by his interest in  Robert Delaunay’s work, in which architectural subjects likewise plays a primary role.Feininger’s early admiration for  Vincent van Gogh seems evident in the heavily impastoed surface and in the use of highly saturated colors, especially yellow, which in the row of houses is beautifully modulated by touches of pink, green, and orange. Also reminiscent of van Gogh are the animated, billowing contours of the houses’ rooftops, which in turn echo the sweeping movement of the clouds. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger deployed a motley crew of grotesque and vaguely sinister characters, some of whom recall Feininger’s earlier cartoons. With their vividly colored costumes, these figures create a striking counterpoint to the dominant yellow of the background. But the ultimate impression is one of dissonance between the grandeur and beauty of the town’s architecture and the bombastic artificiality of its inhabitants. \n—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 144-145.",

With its monumental size, rigorous symmetry, and unabashed splendor, this vase is a superb example of the Empire style inspired by Greco-Roman art. It is a triumph of the collaborative practice of the Sèvres factory; documents reveal the precise roles played by each artist in its creation. Napoleon’s chief architect, Charles Percier, created the Etruscan scroll-handled design. The vase was commissioned by Napoleon in 1805 but was produced only in 1813 and was still at the factory when he was exiled the following year. It was used as a diplomatic gift from his successor, King Louis XVIII, to Viscount Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary and, from 1821, the 2nd Marquess of Londonderry.",

    "tale" : "In this large canvas, Guido Reni, a leading seventeenth-century Bolognese painter, depicted one of the New Testament’s more macabre stories. Salome, the daughter of Queen Herodias, so pleased her stepfather, Herod Antipas, by dancing at his birthday feast that he promised to grant her any wish. Prompted by her vengeful mother, Salome asked for the head of the prophet John the Baptist, whom Herod had imprisoned for denouncing his marriage. The painting illustrates the moment when the head of the saint is presented to the beautiful young woman. Highly selective in his palette, Reni depicted this gory event with rhythmic grace, soft modeling, and elegant remove. No blood drips from John’s head, and the color and illumination are cool; indeed, there is no specific setting, nor are any strong emotions depicted. In this late work, the handling of the figures is broad, especially in the legs of the young page and the feet of Salome, which are only summarily brushed in. This raises the central, unresolved question of much of Reni’s late work: whether or not this picture should be considered finished.",

Driscoll began working for Tiffany in 1888, and she designed the majority of the firm’s lamps before she left the company in 1908 or 1909. Driscoll created at least eight dragonfly shades. This example is distinguished by its large size, glass cabochons, and the placement of insects’ bodies along the lower edge. While Tiffany Studios mass-produced these shades and bases, the firm varied the color scheme of each object to heighten the sense of handcraftsmanship. This daring design became one of Tiffany’s most popular and was made through 1924."

When [there are more details], the impression is weakened or lost, and we see simply an array of external things which may be cleverly painted and may look very real, but which do not make an artistic painting… . The one is poetic truth, the other is scientific truth; the former is aesthetic, the latter is analytic.\" \nIn the course of his lengthy career, Inness increasingly eschewed precision of detail in his paintings, conveying mood and emotion through richness of tone and broadness of handling. He first visited Florida about 1890, and he subsequently established a house and studio in Tarpon Springs, where he executed this painting. In a pink-and-blue morning light, a lone man studies a cluster of buildings in the middle distance. Through blurred outlines and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the figure, Inness masterfully evoked the brightening day and peaceful mood of this moment.",

As imitations of the originals, Gober’s works have an uncanny effect, triggering disquieting thoughts about the most commonplace aspects of daily life. At the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York in 1989, Gober constructed two three-sided rooms defined by temporary sheetrock walls. The room seen here was outfitted with wallpaper depicting alternating images of a sleeping white man and a lynched black man hanging from a tree. At the literal center of the installation, the figure of a bride is strongly conjured by a wedding dress supported by a welded steel armature. The delicate dress stands rigid and empty, waiting to be filled. Gober himself has speculated that the relationship between the bride and the sleeping man in the wallpaper is that of husband and wife. Eight hand-painted plaster bags of cat litter line the walls of the room. A material that absorbs or hides waste, the litter serves as a symbolic remedy for the figurative mess of the bride, groom, and murdered black man. More to the point, however, it speaks to the lasting obligations and intimacy of committed love. On the whole, the room—and the veiled story of the imaginary couple it contains—can be considered a meditation on gender, race, romance, and terrible violence in contemporary American life.",

    "tale" : "This painting of the Holy Family is one of several completed in the decade after Peter Paul Rubens returned to his native Antwerp, following an eight-year stay in Italy. Fully immersed in Italian art, the prodigiously productive artist had acquired such facility in handling brush, color, ﬁgures, and drapery and in arranging large-scale compositions that he was unrivaled north of the Alps. Here he displayed these skills not only by bringing a sacred subject to life but also by bringing it down to earth. Vital and believable Flemish ﬁgures ﬁll the composition, which is dominated by the Virgin clad in a brilliant red dress. The bold, diagonal movement of the playful infants is an effective counterbalance to the full, rounded ﬁgure of Mary. Joseph (Mary’s husband) and Elizabeth (her cousin, and the mother of John the Baptist) frame the pyramidal group as aged and more passive protectors. The atmosphere of joyful solemnity—of light, color, and life—is typical of Rubens and made him the quintessential Baroque artist, in demand as the designer of grand decorative schemes for churches and palaces across Europe.",

    "tale" : "After studying at the École des Beaux-Arts and the École d’Arts et Métiers in Geneva, Alberto Giacometti traveled throughout Italy and finally settled in Paris in 1923. Two years later, despite his formal training in drawing and painting, he began to focus solely on sculpture. During these early years, he forged a path based on a variety of influences, including the formal simplicity of Constantin Brâncusi’s sculpture, aspects of Cubism, and the totemic quality of African art. Spoon Woman was inspired by a type of anthropomorphic spoon carved by the Dan people of West Africa; such works were exhibited frequently in Paris during the 1920s and were the subject of great fascination for artists, including Giacometti. Drawing on the frontality and cultural significance of these implements, he presented his female figure as a symbol of fertility. Topped by a set of simple blocks to suggest her torso and head, the woman’s wide, curving womb is represented by the concave section of the spoon. Giacometti’s interest in female totems extended beyond the art of the Dan; in the 1920s he studied and sketched prehistoric female figures—symbols of fertility and mystery—that were in the collections of many museums.",

    "tale" : "After receiving his artistic training in Italy, the sculptor and painter Amedeo Modigliani moved to Paris in 1906. Three years later, he helped pioneer a general migration of artists to the neighborhood of Montparnasse, which remained the center of avant-gard activity in the city until World War II. Scores of artists lived there, and many of them shared a Jewish heritage—including Modigliani and his friend the Lithuanian-born sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. \nLipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian poet Berthe Kitrosser, as a way of helping his troubled friend financially. The double portrait is one of only three in the artist’s oeuvre and, according to Lipchitz, took two days to paint. Modigliani made about twenty drawings on the first day; the next day, he declared the picture finished. At the modest price of what Lipchitz remembered as “ten francs per sitting and a little alcohol,” however, he persuaded Modigliani to work on the portrait for another two weeks in an effort to provide more financial assistance to his friend. Despite Modigliani’s exceptional talent, his work found a market only after his death in 1920, which was hastened by tuberculosis and his legendary bohemian lifestyle.",

    "tale" : "This rare and important sculpture represents a Buddhist bodhisattva, or bosatsu, an enlightened and compassionate being who postponed Buddhahood in order to help save others. Calm, stately, and full-bodied, the bosatsu is seated in a frontal, meditative pose; his gracefully held hands, raised midair, make a gesture of assurance. Buddhism, which originated in India with the teachings of the Buddha Sakyamuni, or Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563-c. 483 B.C.), was named the official religion of Japan at the beginning of the eighth century by the Emperor Shomu (701-56). This small, finely crafted lacquer figure is the only Buddhist sculpture outside Japan that is firmly attributed to the influential sculpture workshop of Todai-ji, the largest and most prestigious of the great state-sponsored Buddhist temples built during the Nara period. This sculpture represents a dramatic shift in Japanese sculptural tradition—a move away from the expensive, time-consuming technique of using lacquer (a resin extracted from the sap of a tree) over a temporary clay core that, once removed, left a sculpture that was completely hollow except for perhaps a wood bracing system. Here a sculpted wood core is overlaid with lacquer-soaked cloth. The innovative sculptors at the Nara temple modeled the wet and pliable surface of the cloth to create fine details such as facial features and jewelry. Finally the sculpture was gilt; traces of gold remain on the bodhisattva’s face and chest.",

    "tale" : "Among the most impressive achievements of the Sienese master Giovanni di Paolois his narrative series of twelve panels illustrating the life of Saint John the Baptist—from his birth, prophecy, and the baptism of Christ through his beheading at the request of Salome. These scenes are enacted in complex settings that exploit the tall, slender proportions of the panels and set off the expressive poses of the figures. The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist depicts the henchmen of Queen Herodias placing his head on a golden platter. The execution has just occurred; blood spews profusely from the elongated neck of the saint. The rich patterning of the architecture, painted in a light, delicate palette, contrasts with the gruesome trails of blood falling to the ground and collecting beneath the decapitated corpse. The distant landscape was inspired by the hills around Siena. Throughout the series, Giovanni skillfully repeated colors, settings, and patterns to create a unified narrative. Eleven of the original twelve panels survive, six of which are in the Art Institute. The panels were arranged in three rows to form two large, movable doors, possibly once enclosing a sculpture or relic.",

Tiepolo enjoyed an international career and was called upon to use his mastery of light, color, and illusion to transform palaces and monasteries in his native Venice and elsewhere in Italy, as well as in Germany and Spain. This painting and three others at the Art Institute, together with smaller decorative panels and a ceiling painting, once graced the cabinet of mirrors, a richly decorated room in the Venetian palace of the powerful Cornaro family. The suite illustrates Torquato Tasso’s popular sixteenth-century epic romance Jerusalem Delivered, which is set in the eleventh century, during the First Crusade, when Western knights sought to take Jerusalem from the Muslims. The canvas captures the moment of Rinaldo’s seduction: the beautiful sorceress Armida has just arrived to divert the sleeping hero from his crusade. Accompanied by her attendant nymph and a cupid figure, she appears like a beautiful mirage, enthroned on a billowing cloud, her drapery and shawl wafting gently behind her. Altough Tasso’s story symbolizes the conﬂict between love and duty, Tiepolo’s depiction of a magical, bucolic world—enhanced by effervescent colors, luminous atmosphere, and dense, creamy paint—seems to evoke only love’s enchantment.",

    "tale" : "The self-taught artist Horace Pippin began painting as a means of therapy, hoping to regain the mobility of his right arm, which had been injured in World War I. He became one of the most celebrated African American artists of the mid-twentieth century, as critics acclaimed the power and authenticity of his “primitive” style. Cabin in the Cotton, the painting that brought him to the attention of the art world, displays Pippin’s vivid, saturated palette and feeling for intense pattern. \nLiving in Pennsylvania, Pippin may have seen cotton fields during visits to relatives in the South, but it is more likely that he drew on popular culture for inspiration. The way of life in the rural South enjoyed a great vogue in the 1930s, with the premiere of George Gershwin’s opera Porgy and Bess in 1935 and the publication of Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind in 1936. In particular, the painting’s composition recalls the opening and closing sequences of the 1932 film Cabin in the Cotton, starring Bette Davis. In that year, both Bing Crosby and Cab Calloway made recordings of a song titled “Cabin in the Cotton.” \nIn 1937 Christian Brinton, an influential art critic, and N. C. Wyeth, the famous illustrator, discovered Cabin in the Cotton in the window of a shoe-repair shop in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and convinced Pippin to begin exhibiting. Newspapers then widely reported that the actor Charles Laughton had purchased the painting, prompting other celebrities and art collectors, as well as museums, to acquire Pippin’s work, which assured his lasting fame.",

    "tale" : "During Raphaelle Peale’s time, still life was not esteemed by most artists, relegated to the bottom of the hierarchy of painting subjects. Yet Peale ignored its low status and is now acknowledged as America’s first professional still-life painter and leading practitioner of the genre. Born into an artistic Philadelphia family, Raphaelle was the eldest son of Charles Willson Peale and the nephew of James Peale, both artists; his siblings were, like him, named after famous old master painters (he had brothers named Rembrandt, Titian, and Rubens). Characterized by crisp forms and serenely balanced compositions, most of Peale’s still lifes portray food, crockery, and glassware arranged on a plain shelf, parallel to the picture plane. In this particularly fine example, the rhythmic balance of fruit, nuts, and Chinese export porcelain is enlivened by the diagonal branch of grapes becoming raisins and an orange leaf. These objects are brightly illuminated against a bare, dark background in the manner of the dramatic still-life compositions of 17th-century painters such as Juan Sánchez Cotán. Peale may have seen the Spanish artist’s work when it was shown at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1818.",

    "tale" : "Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity. \nAreas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.",

    "tale" : "This remarkable ensemble is made up of a retable, which was set up behind the altar table, and a frontal, which decorated the front of the table itself. The work is literally a testament to the piety of Pedro López de Ayala, a major figure in the political and cultural life of late medieval Spain. He was a courtier, soldier, and diplomat in the service of the kings of Castile, eventually serving as chancellor; he also wrote poetry, a treatise on hunting, and important chronicles of his era. \nAyala expected his altarpiece to be a perpetual plea for his eternal salvation and that of his family. Indeed, for more than five hundred years, it decorated the family’s funerary chapel in their fortified palace in northern Spain. Ayala was careful to declare his donation of the altarpiece in honor of Christ and the Virgin Mary through the inscription that runs across the bottom margin; the images of himself and his wife, Leonora de Guzman, kneeling in prayer with their son and daughter-in-law at either end of the lower register; and their coats of arms — two wolves and two cauldrons —  alternating around the frames. \nThe massive altarpiece must have been constructed and painted inside the small chapel. To accomplish this, Ayala called upon local artists, who created a series of scenes that tell the stories of the life of Christ and the Virgin and center on images of the Crucifixion and of an empty throne that probably once framed a statue of the Virgin and Child. These scenes are not projections of convincing pictorial space. Rather, with their plain backgrounds and framing arcades, they hark back to earlier architectural decoration and manuscript illumination. The altarpiece was clearly intended to impress through its monumental scale, its narrative clarity, and its costly materials, which include gold and silver leaf and glazes of rare and expensive ultramarine blue."

    "tale" : "Max Beckmann was one of the Weimar Republic’s most honored artists and one of those most vilified by the Nazis. This self-portrait was perhaps the last painting the artist completed in Berlin before he and his wife fled to the Netherlands on July 20, 1937. Their flight occurred just two days after Adolf Hitler delivered a speech condemning modern art and one day after the opening of the exhibition Degenerate Art, the Nazis’ official denigration of the avant-garde, which included twenty-two of Beckmann’s works. The artist departed Germany just in time: in 1937 more than five hundred of his works were confiscated from public collections. \nThe most brilliantly colored and aggressive of all of Beckmann’s self-portraits (he painted over eighty), this powerful work depicts the artist, near life size, on the staircase of a hotel lobby, separated from two figures in the background on the right. Beckmann steps to the left, while his dark-rimmed gaze and the entire picture plane—curtains, flowers, staircase, and banisters—seem to slide off to the right. His large hands hang down, limp, against his black tuxedo.",

    "tale" : "Carved by a sculptor of exceptional talent, this exquisite portrait bust depicts an elegant Roman woman of wealth and distinction. The subject bears a solemn expression as she looks to her left, which affords a tantalizing glimpse of her intricate hairstyle. The wavy locks that frame her face are combed to the back, where they are woven into numerous braids, nearly all of which are wound into a heavy, multitiered bun worn at the upper part of the back of the head. This coiffure emulates a type worn by Faustina the Elder (d. AD 141), wife of Emperor Antoninus Pius (r. AD 138–61), suggesting that she lived during this period. A gem-encrusted diadem encircles the subject’s head, alluding to her elevated social standing. Her garments are similarly luxurious, including her crisply pleated, gap-sleeved tunic, which is so thinly carved that light passes through parts of the marble. Out of modesty she also wears an overgarment, its deep folds indicating a thick material, possibly wool. Draped low across her torso, the mantle reveals the gentle swell of her right breast, an unusual feature of Roman busts of this period.",

    "tale" : "Paul Klee was an artist and teacher at the Bauhaus for most of that famed school’s existence. Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.” \nKlee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like Sunset reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”",

In these delicate screens, premier court painter Tosa Mitsuoki meditated on the inevitable passage of beauty by depicting the melancholy hours after the departure of reveling courtiers. A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen (seen here at top), while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called tanzaku, waft from the blossoming limbs, the lingering signs of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early medieval aristocratic life."

    "tale" : "Emphasizing the basics of line, shape, and color, Ellsworth Kelly’s exquisitely spare paintings and sculpture influenced the development of Minimalist art and affected the course of color-field painting, hard-edge painting, and postpainterly abstraction. Among the Art Institute’s rich holdings of Kelly’s works, Red Yellow Blue White and Black stands apart: with startling clarity, this painting marks the moment at midcentury when Kelly’s pure abstraction emerged in its mature form. After serving in World War II, the artist returned to Europe in 1948, living and working in France for the following six years. While abroad, Kelly expanded his practice of direct observation of nature and architectural forms into an experimental, rigorous study of abstraction. He made Red Yellow Blue White and Black in 1953 while still in France, creating it just as he was beginning to uncover the nearly infinite possibilities of monochrome, color spectrum, chance ordering, and multipanel composition. In the painting, Kelly centered the black panel so that it both divides and joins the three panels on either side of it, while the white panels simultaneously separate colors and pair them off. The blue panels at either end close and unify the sequence. Kelly’s multipanel monochromes rely on the edges where sections meet, instead of handmade marks, to express their form. This seven-panel painting is the largest in a sequence of Paris-based works widely considered to be the artist’s finest and most influential early statements on canvas.",

    "tale" : "The young Baccio della Porta came under the spell of the charismatic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, joining his monastic order as Fra (Friar) Bartolommeo in 1500 and forsaking his painting career for several years. Returning to painting in 1504, he looked to the most lyrical and harmonious recent works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo to form his own style, which was characterized by a new, quiet spirituality. The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews. Reinforcing this device is a young tree springing from a remnant of ancient stones directly above the infant.",

This cartoon is for a tapestry in a series decorating the dining room of the Prince of Asturias, in the Palace of El Pardo, outside Madrid.

    "tale" : "British artist Steve McQueen’s projected video and film installations are rich in cinematic tradition and compelling in content. His earliest works—black-and-white silent films—are indebted to 1960s structural filmmaking, wherein the mechanics of shooting and projection become essential components of the film’s subject. His more recent work explores the relation between the medium and the spectator. At once confrontational and seductive, these colossally scaled works transform a purely visual experience into a visceral event. Presented as a single installation, Caribs’ Leap and Western Deep are linked by the theme of descent. The dual-screen projection Caribs’ Leap juxtaposes luminous scenes of the beachfront on the island of Grenada—the birthplace of McQueen’s parents—with irregular images of tiny figures falling through a vast sky. The latter pay homage to the island’s indigenous Caribs, who in 1651 leapt to their death rather than surrender to the invading French. In Western Deep, the viewer takes a nightmarish journey into the hot, noisy depths of a South African goldmine. Presented and considered together, these two films suggestively liken modern mining conditions to a historical act of genocide.",

At the age of sixty-four, Heade settled in Saint Augustine, Florida. There he began painting detailed arrangements of native flowers, including the Cherokee rose, orange blossom, and magnolia. Stretched out like an odalisque on blue velvet cloth, the curvaceous magnolia was meticulously rendered in pale, subtle hues and illuminated by a light so sharp that the image evokes the hyperintensity of a dream. The warm, steamy atmosphere is almost palpable, as is the blossom’s heady, pungent scent. The Art Institute’s Magnolias is one of a number of compositions by the artist featuring this dramatic yet delicate white flower.",

Remarkable for their sculptural naturalism, these stirrup-spout bottles were molded without the aid of a potter’s wheel and painted in earth tones. Moche potters represented everything about their world, from domestic scenes to architecture, ritual events and royal personages, and animals and plants. This portrait vessel portrays individual characteristics—the furrowed brow and full, slightly protruding upper lip—as well as general features recognizable among Peruvian Indians today. With his commanding expression and proud bearing, the depicted ruler conveys an indelible sense of the power of Moche leaders. His elite status is further indicated by his fine headdress, decorated with the geometric motifs of Moche textiles, and by his elongated ear ornaments and the traces of facial paint on his forehead and cheeks. Vessels such as this were placed in burials as funerary offerings, but before they accompanied an individual to the grave, they may also have been sent as emblems of royal authority from a center of power to neighboring districts along with gifts of textiles and other ceremonial presents.",

    "tale" : "The volatile events of the early years of the French Revolution make it impossible to determine with certainty the date of Jacques-Louis David’s warm, fresh portrait of Adélaïde de Pastoret. They also probably account for the portrait’s unfinished state. David, a renowned Neoclassical painter, was at the time an ardent revolutionary; Madame de Pastoret was the wife of a staunch royalist. The sittings must have occurred after the birth, early in 1791, of her son, who is portrayed asleep by her side, and before her brief imprisonment during the Reign of Terror in 1792. Here David completed the stippled, almost monochromatic underpainting but did not create the stark, enamel-smooth surface that is characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even get far enough to place a needle and thread in Madame de Pastoret’s hand. Nevertheless, this large portrait of unaffected domesticity captures the youthful mother with charm as well as dignity and displays David’s skill as a portraitist. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret (who became the Marquise de Pastoret in 1817) refused the painting during the artist’s lifetime. After David’s death, she had her son, by then an adult, purchase the portrait from the artist’s estate.",

    "tale" : "Soon after Joan Miró moved to Paris from his native Barcelona in 1920, he met a group of avant-garde painters and writers who advocated merging the everyday rational world with that of dreams and the unconscious in order to produce an absolute reality, or surreality. To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Miró experimented with automatism: “Even a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,” he said, “may suggest the beginning of a picture.” Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the “dream paintings,” which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions. In The Policeman, a large canvas from this group, two biomorphic shapes spring to life as a policeman and a horse, their forms defined by thinly applied white paint against a neutral ocher ground. The form on the left has sprouted five buds that act as fingers, and both forms extrude curves that suggest torsos or mouths.

    "tale" : "Paul Gauguin traveled to rural France and then abroad in search of inspiration for his art. His quest took the former stockbroker to the French regions of Brittany and Provence, to Panama and Martinique, and finally to Tahiti and the Marquesas in the South Pacific. This stately portrait of Gauguin’s young Tahitian vahine (lover), Tehamana, is perhaps a farewell, since it was painted shortly before the artist left the island, returning to France for two years. Elaborately dressed, her hair decorated with ﬂowers, Tehamana is seated in front of a mysterious painted background reminiscent of a frieze on the wall of an ancient palace or temple. Two ripe mangoes—perhaps an offering or symbol of fertility—rest beside her hip. She points a fan, an emblem of beauty, toward the similarly frontal figure of a goddess, who also wears a red ﬂower in her hair. The fan, ﬂowers, fruit, and even Tehamana’s glance suggest not only the strong, enigmatic bond between these two figures but also the connections between the present and the past, the corporeal and the spiritual, and the living and the dead.",

    "tale" : "This stela was colored with a mixture of pigment and tempera. First, however, it was sculpted in raised and sunken relief; only later were some of its surfaces embellished with black, brown, green, yellow, and white paint. It commemorates for all eternity a man named Amenemhat and his wife, Hemet. Before them are two offering tables stacked with food. Their son appears in the upper right at a smaller scale. In addition to the hieroglyphs in the field, a brief text also appears on the top and right border. \nEgyptian art is highly symbolic. The left side of the composition is the dominant position; the placement there of Amenemhat and Hemet conveys their importance. He stands in front of his wife, stressing that he is the head of the household. The social difference between them is indicated by the color of their skin. His is dark reddish brown and hers is yellow; he is active outdoors, while the home is her realm. They both wear traditional clothing and jewelry. \nThe goal of the artist was to immortalize the essential elements of his subjects. This representation reflects conventions for portraying the human form as a composite diagram made up of different views. Amenemhat and Hemet are shown with their heads in profile, their shoulders frontal, and their chests, buttocks, and legs in profile. These positions offered the most characteristic and comprehensive views of the human form. Also, depth is represented by height, so the offerings at the top of the composition should be understood as the farthest away. \nThe brightly colored, raised-relief hieroglyphs within the scene record the names of the subjects, their lineage, and voice offerings, which refer to the belief that offerings could consist of actual food, images of food, written references to it, or the recitation of prayers that call for provisions. Carved in sunken relief and painted blue, hieroglyphs along the top and right record a conventional prayer for food to sustain Amenemhat and Hemet in the afterlife.",

    "tale" : "A photographer as well as a painter, Charles Sheeler considered the purposes of art as carefully as anyone of his generation of early twentieth-century modernists. In both media, he usually drew his subjects from the world of constructed objects: urban architecture, factories, and barns, as well as interiors often furnished with the spare, elegant eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Shaker furniture he admired. These subjects were rendered (or, in the case of his most abstract paintings, suggested) in a hard-edged, controlled technique indicative of the artist’s restrained and intellectual point of view and interest in formal values. \nFor the typically objective Sheeler, The Artist Looks at Nature is an unusual work because it represents an imaginary scene. Here we see the artist outdoors, but what is before him is not what is on his easel. The unfinished work reproduces Interior with Stove (1932; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), a much earlier Conté-crayon drawing based on an even earlier photograph by the artist. Thus, in the Art Institute’s painting, we see Sheeler almost playfully reconstructing his own past over a period of more than twenty-five years, emphasizing the self-referential nature of his art and suggesting the interchange between the representational modes of photography and painting. One of Sheeler’s most complex yet charming works, The Artist Looks at Nature implies much about the ironies and ambiguities of art in the last century.",

    "tale" : "Like that of many African Americans, Walter Ellison’s life was shaped by the Great Migration, the massive movement of blacks from the rural South to the urban North after World War I. Originally from Eatonton, Georgia, he moved to Chicago in the 1920s; in the following decade, he attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and was employed by the Illinois Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. \nMany African American writers and artists, including Richard Wright and Jacob Lawrence, used trains as powerful metaphors. On one hand, they can symbolize movement, the future, and hope for prosperity. On the other, they can signify displacement, dispossession, and loss. Ellison’s Train Station depicts an energetic scene in which many travelers depart from a central terminal. The composition reflects how values in the 1930s prevented blacks and whites from mixing. Each of the painting’s three sections reveals the artist’s perceptions of the injustices associated with inequitable social conditions. On the left, white passengers board southbound trains for vacations, while, on the right, black passengers board northbound trains for destinations such as Chicago and Detroit, hopeful of being welcomed in cities where they can prosper. A sign above a doorway on the platform identifying the colored-only exit further underscores the dehumanizing conditions that African Americans had to endure at this time. In the center section, black porters help white passengers, but black travelers proceed unassisted. \nThe sharply exaggerated perspective creates a space that appears physically inaccessible, perhaps symbolizing remote destinations and unimaginable conditions at the end of the journey. By placing his initials on the suitcase that an old man in the right foreground tries to lift, Ellison inscribed his own experiences of racism and economic struggle into the work, creating an autobiographical account of his personal migration north.",

    "tale" : "The groundbreaking innovations of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe left a lasting impact on both the practice and teaching of architecture in the United States, especially in Chicago. As director of the School of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Mies stressed the importance of bold, clean designs based on structure, materials, and function. Stanley Tigerman was among the many architects schooled in the Miesian tradition, and he based much of his work in the 1960s and 1970s on the designs of the famed architect. Tigerman’s restless curiosity and iconoclastic spirit, however, led him to question the authority and durability of Mies’s program. The Titanic is a conceptual project that was meant to provoke architects to contend with the Mies legacy, challenging them to choose sides: move beyond Mies or remain cemented to the past. The photocollage pitches Mies’s Crown Hall (1950–56), one of the architect’s most iconic and revered designs, into the deep. Tigerman mailed copies of the work to members of the architectural establishment, including an offer of a one-way ticket on the Titanic. Although the title of the work portends the end of Mies’s dominance, Tigerman acknowledged that many would see the building as rising back to the surface, ever triumphant.",

A central section, now lost, probably featured the enthroned Virgin and Child, perhaps with Saint Anne. Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins,was the leading painter working in France in the last decades of the fifteenth century. He worked in Moulins in central France for Duke Pierre II of Bourbon and his wife, Anne of France, who played a large role in the government of of the kingdom during the minority of Anne’s brother Charles VIII. As their court painter, Hey, who was probably of Netherlandish origin, fused the intense naturalism and preciousness of Flemish and French painting and manuscript illumination with the emerging Renais-sance interest in antiquity, as is evident in this painting’s Italianate architecture.",

Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture. The expressive, idyllic quality of this painting presages the radiant ceiling frescoes of Correggio’s maturity, especially those in Parma’s Cathedral.",

However, the floral background is actually one of Manet’s paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio. \nWoman Reading is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.",

Ingres astutely captured the character of the suave young nobleman, from the refined line of his silhouette to his elegant costume, long fingers, and slightly swaggering pose. The artist’s fastidious, impeccable technique is particularly evident in the precisely rendered details of the sword hilt and the medal of the Order of the Legion of Honor, which the count received in 1824. Ingres studied in the prestigious atelier of Jacques-Louis David; although he considered himself a history painter, portraits such as this paid his bills for many years and earned him considerable praise. This work was in progress at about the same time that the count acquired a painting of his mother by David at the artist’s posthumous sale. In 1897 Amédée-David, the Comte de Pastoret was purchased by the painter Edgar Degas, an avid art collector and admirer of Ingres, who, like the older artist, became the greatest French portrait painter of his generation.",

    "tale" : "A ferocious image of grief, Weeping Woman I is one of the most powerful works that Pablo Picasso undertook in the wake of his seminal Guernica (1937; Museo del Prado, Madrid). After completing Guernica, an expression of the horrors of war and a critique of fascist tyranny, Picasso continued to be drawn to the subject of agonized grief. Between June and December 1937, he undertook a series of drawings, paintings, and prints known as The Weeping Women, in which he focused and elaborated on two figures first presented in Guernica. The figure in this print may also represent the artist’s lover, the Surrealist photographer Dora Maar. In Weeping Woman I, Picasso drew inspiration from contemporary events and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century religious imagery. He modernized the traditional theme of the Virgin Mary lamenting the death of her son. The importance Picasso accorded this etching is suggested not only by its size—it was the largest plate he had yet attempted—but also by the energy he invested in it. He developed the finished print through seven independent states. It seems that he felt the need to work and rework this image, perhaps in an effort to exorcise the demons of war and his difficult relationship with Maar.",

    "tale" : "The painting of Classical ruins had reached the zenith of its popularity when Hubert Robert, the leading French practitioner of this specialty, was commissioned in 1787 to paint a suite of four canvases for a wealthy financier’s château at Méréville, near Paris. The Fountains and its companion pieces were set into the paneled walls of a salon in the château, creating an alternate space that played off of the elegant, Neoclassical decor of the room. Robert has studied in Rome from 1754 to 1765 and there had gleaned his artistic vocabulary. Like the other three large paintings from the group painted for Méréville, all in the Art Institute, The Fountains exploits Robert’s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space. The four paintings are inhabited by tiny figures in the foreground; these serve only to set the scale and animate the scene, for the ruins themselves are the true subject of the pictures. In his use of ruins, Robert embodied the notion of the relationship of mankind and the built environment to nature that was expressed by the French philosopher and encyclopedist Denis Diderot: “Everything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.”",

His work originated under the auspices of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s and early 1950s and advanced uniquely along lines afforded by its freedoms. Twombly’s entire enterprise is characterized by unruly marks—stammering, energetic, and raw—that merge drawing, painting, writing, and symbolic glyphs. Scrawled, overwritten, erased, or willfully misspelled, words cite people, places, events, and stories nominally derived from Greco-Roman culture and history, especially literature, poetry, and myth."

    "tale" : "The evocative, symbolic art of Odilon Redon drew its inspiration from the internal world of his imagination. For years this student of Rodolphe Bresdin worked only in black and white, producing powerful and haunting charcoal drawings, lithographs, and etchings. Just as these black works, or Noirs, began to receive critical and public acclaim in the 1890s, Redon discovered the marvels of color through the use of pastel. His immersion in color and this new technique brought about a change in the artist’s approach to his subject matter as well. Flower Clouds is one of a number of pastels executed around 1905 that are dominated by spiritual overtones. Here a sailboat bears two figures, perhaps two saintly women, on a timeless journey through a fantastic, phosphorescent sea and sky. The dreamlike skiff may reflect Redon’s internal voyage, replacing the nocturnal turmoil of the earlier Noirs with a more hopeful vision. The luminous intensity of the pastels echoes the ardent spirituality of the theme.",

    "tale" : "Roy Lichtenstein rose to prominence at the beginning of the 1960s and became one of the best-known practitioners of Pop Art. His brightly painted canvases depicting everyday objects, as well as scenes of war and romance culled from the pages of contemporary comics, were rendered in stylized black outlines and hand-painted Ben Day dots that mimicked the commercial printing process. Thus he seemed to elevate what was often seen as low art—both its quotidian, affective subject matter and its visual terms—into high art. This was never simply a straightforward process of reversal, however, and by mid-decade Lichtenstein began to focus on subjects that reflected his lifelong interest in art historical themes. \nBrushstroke with Spatter, from the Brushstroke series (1965–67), is a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. This deadpan rendering is not purely comic, but also establishes a tension key to the work’s success as an abstract painting in its own right, with grand scalar play and dramatic cropping, intensity of color, and the optical pulse of the dotted ground."

His works frequently have the formal clarity of documentary photography or photojournalism, but he often relies on staged or constructed artifices. This image is the result of two years of work, during which the artist fused countless photographs of both documentary and fabricated scenes into a single, surreal whole. After taking pictures in two Vancouver cemeteries over the course of several months, Wall built an aquatic system in his studio, crafting the tank from a plaster cast of an actual grave. With the aid of marine-life specialists, the artist cultivated a living, underwater ecosystem identical to one found off the coast of Vancouver. In the finished product, the two worlds are married through a technical process that presents the illusion of a water-filled grave. The Flooded Grave therefore challenges the notion of the photograph as the record of a single moment in time; instead, it is an elaborate fantasy on the subconscious life of the image it projects.",

    "tale" : "Gino Severini was a member of the Futurists, a group of Italian artists that announced its existence with a manifesto published in 1909 on the front page of Le Figaro. The Futurists urged others to ignore the past and focus on the aesthetic power of modern life. Their paintings celebrate modernity—the speed, thrill, and especially the danger of factories, airplanes, automobiles, locomotives, and steamships. Their style blended Divisionism and Cubism to render “dynamic sensation” and the interpenetration of objects and their environment by superimposing different chromatic planes and lines of force. \nSeverini’s work focused on Parisian entertainments, nightlife, and street activities. In Festival in Montmartre, he depicted the centrifugal motion of a carousel and the liberating, yet destabilizing, effects of color, speed, and sound. The artist presented this work in his first solo exhibition in 1913, writing in the catalogue, “My object has been to convey the sensation of a body, lighted by electric lamps and gyrating in the darkness of the boulevard. The shapes of the pink pigs and of the women seated on them are subordinate the whole, the rotary movement of which they follow while undergoing displacement from head to foot and vice versa.”"

For this monumental painting, the artist transformed an episode from Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), in which Professor Otto Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the earth. Delvaux showed the professor at left, examining a rock or fossil; behind him stands Axel, who bears a striking resemblance to the artist himself. Under a full moon, a group of women in the background appear like automatons. In the foreground, several figures combine human and vegetal elements; these ambiguous figures seem to embody a primordial, as yet undifferentiated, state. A woman in the right foreground and another in the left middle ground, both in Victorian dress, hold lamps and try in a vain to shed light on the unyielding mystery of the scene. Despite the multitude of naked figures and their detailed description, The Awakening of the Forest retains a detachment that adds to its strange and mysterious effect.",

    "tale" : "“I paint the things I have experienced,” Jacob Lawrence stated. Raised in Harlem, Lawrence studied at various federally funded community cultural centers and art workshops, where his talent was quickly recognized. The young artist soon applied his bold, unique style to the creation of narrative cycles devoted to African American history, leaders, and life. His sixty-panel Migration series (1940–41), depicting the resettlement of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North in the first half of the twentieth century, debuted in 1941 at the prestigious Downtown Gallery in New York. This exhibition bought national attention to the artist, then only in his early twenties. The cycle was acquired later by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Phillips Collection, Washington, DC. \nIn addition to his various series, Lawrence also executed individual genre scenes, such as The Wedding, throughout his long career. With its bright, flat colors, bold patterning, and economical yet suggestive forms, this vibrant composition shows a bride and groom, flanked by two attendants, standing before a stern-faced minister. This arrangement makes us, like the attendants, participants in a major life event. Befitting both the solemnity and joy of a wedding, the composition combines the symmetrical rigidity of the standing figures with a riotous profusion of intensely colored stained-glass panels and flowers. The Wedding demonstrates well what one writer described as Lawrence’s unwavering commitment “to make his subject a testament, an expression of his belief in [humanity’s] continuing strength.”",

Here Naymlap stands with his arms to his abdomen and his feet splayed outward. His gold headdress has an elaborate open filigree design. Turquoise—for the peoples of ancient Peru, a precious gem related to the worship of water and sky—is inlaid around the headdress cap and in the ear ornaments. The tumi was made with diverse metalworking techniques. Solid casting was used to produce the blade. The face and body were created with annealing (heating, shaping, and then cooling) and repoussé, in which the relief design is hammered into a mold from the reverse side. Finally, the small ornaments around the top of the headdress were separately hammered or cast, then soldered into place. This tumi and many other gold, silver, and textile objects were made in royal workshops and ceremonially presented to high officials as emblems of rank and authority.",

    "tale" : "This work is Pablo Picasso’s first large Cubist sculpture and represents the distinctive physiognomy of Fernande Olivier, the artist’s model and companion from 1905 until 1912. Before making the bust, Picasso produced countless drawings and gouaches to explore the specific form and structure of his subject’s facial features—her dark almond-shaped eyes, sharp nose, peaked upper lip, ﬂeshy chin, and braided topknot. He also looked to African and ancient Iberian sculpture to guide his translation of Fernande’s profile into the geometric language of Cubism. Converting his studies to three dimensions, Picasso simultaneously built up and cut away the clay as he worked, giving the surface a unifying rhythm of light and shadow. The resulting bronze retains the basic shape of Fernande’s head, though the surface and structure are broken up into faceted, fragmented forms. \nThe Art Institute’s bronze is one of a small edition produced by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1910. It was sold in 1912 to the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz, who published his own photographs of the work in his journal Camera Work.",

    "tale" : "In 1839 Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre announced the perfection of the daguerreotype, a photographic process that employed a silver-coated copperplate sensitive to light. This new artistic process was celebrated for its remarkably sharp detail and praised as a “democratic art” that brought portraiture into reach for the masses. Within a few years, thousands of daguerrean portrait studios had sprung up all over the United States, among them the one that Samuel J. Miller owned in Akron, Ohio. Although most of the likenesses made in commercial studios were formulaic and not very revealing of the subject’s character, this portrait of Frederick Douglass—an escaped slave who had become a lauded speaker, writer, and abolitionist agitator—is a striking exception. Northeastern Ohio was a center of abolitionism prior to the Civil War, and Douglass knew that this picture, one of an astonishing number that he commissioned or posed for, would be seen by ardent supporters of his campaign to end slavery. Douglass was an intelligent manager of his public image and likely guided Miller in projecting his intensity and sheer force of character. As a result, this portrait demonstrates that Douglass truly appeared “majestic in his wrath,” as the nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton observed."

A sculptor and illustrator as well as a painter, Remington was famous for his dynamic compositions of frontier life, which presented mythic, romanticized views of the American West in tantalizing color and detail. Although he traveled to western locations to sketch or gather material on assignment, he executed most of his work in his New York studio, including The Advance-Guard, which was later reproduced in Harper’s Weekly alongside an article authored by the artist."

    "tale" : "Regarded as one of the most innovative artists of his generation, Bruce Nauman has produced an oeuvre of stunning diversity, encompassing works of film, installation, performance, photography, sculpture, and video. He creates profoundly aesthetic experiences that are often aimed at disrupting viewers’ habits of perception. In the mid-1960s the artist adopted the medium of flashing neon in order to critically examine the role of language in visual art. Inspired by its hypnotic aura and non-art aesthetic, Nauman began using this quintessentially commercial medium in an ironic way, as a vehicle for wordplay, puns, and jokes. The artist created this neon sign for an invitational sculpture exhibition held in Chicago in 1985. Three pairs of words, antithetical in their connotations, line the six-foot circumference: life and death, love and hate, and pleasure and pain. In the center, human, animal, and nature are repeated in stacked sets of two. Each word blinks independently, ordered so that over several minutes all possible permutations are displayed. Juxtapositions of colors produce optical illusions that create a jarring, visceral effect. This work ultimately insists on language’s inability to deliver a fixed or stable set of meanings, conveying a deep suspicion about what constitutes truth, especially in the public realm.",

    "tale" : "During the summer and fall of 1915, Kazimir Malevich secluded himself to prepare for the groundbreaking exhibition 0.10 (Zero-Ten) The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings. Seeking to push the formal discoveries of Cubism and Futurism to their limits, to find the most essential core—the “zero”—of painting, Malevich produced a series of completely abstract works that he declared constituted an entirely new system of art. Suprematism, as he called the new style, eradicated all references to the natural world and focused instead on the inherent relationships between colored geometric shapes against the void of a subtly textured white background. In the exhibition catalogue he warned, “In naming some of the paintings I do not wish to point out what form to seek in them, but I wish to indicate that real forms were approached in many cases as the ground for formless painterly masses from which a painterly picture was created, quite unrelated to nature.” Painterly Realism of a Football Player—Color Masses in the 4th Dimension belongs to this very first group of Suprematist works. The subtitle refers to the mathematical theory of fourth dimensional space, a concept appropriated by many early twentieth-century artists to justify their representation of truths beyond immediate sensory perception."

Davis studied at Henri’s New York school, but he eventually came to disagree with his teacher’s belief in the preeminence of content over composition and form; instead, he created a style in which he generalized and abstracted his shapes and the spaces between them. \nNonetheless, Davis’s art is never totally abstract. Twentieth-century America is reflected in the shapes and colors he chose and in the sheer vitality of his compositions. His style—big, bright, bold, and clear—is completely appropriate to his subject matter. Forms have been reduced to large colored planes; words or numbers are simplified and offered as elements of design. In Ready-to-Wear, the bright, unmixed colors recall those of the French artist Fernand Léger. The way in which they intersect and interrupt one another, however, conveys a mood that is distinctly American: energetic, jazzy, mass produced—all qualities summed up in the title. The planes, reminiscent of overlapping pasted-down paper cutouts, even suggest the garment patterns from which ready-to-wear clothes are assembled.",

    "tale" : "Eldzier Cortor was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1916 and moved with his family to the South Side of Chicago a year later. His coursework at the School of the Art Institute exposed him not only to the Art Institute’s iconic Western paintings but also to the Field Museum’s extraordinary collection of African art. When he decided to become a painter, he was drawn to abstraction but decided that nonobjective painting was incompatible with his desire to represent the African American experience and convey social messages with his art. \nThe Room No. VI is one of the finest examples of Cortor’s mature work, intended to expose the impoverished living conditions experienced by many African Americans on the South Side. Circumstances for many residents were challenging, as racism, segregation, and the increasing pace of migration of rural blacks from the South placed significant pressures on the limited housing stock. Entire families resided together, often in what were called “kitchenettes”—inadequate one-room spaces with limited access to kitchens or bathrooms. Despite his pressing social message, however, Cortor emphasized formal elements of pattern and texture, particularly the shapes and brilliant colors of the bed linens, floorboards, and wallpaper, whose dynamic, decorative appearance helps alleviate the bleakness of the scene. Cortor achieved a fundamental rethinking of the idiom of social realism that conveys the hardships of African American life in Chicago, even as he endowed the subject with a profound dignity and grace.",

    "tale" : "Fernand Léger first saw the work of the Cubists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at the Paris gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Around 1909 Léger began to experiment with geometric shapes, complementary colors, and strong outlines, although his paintings remained largely nonrepresentational until after World War I. His involvement in the war had a profound impact on his work. In the years following, he introduced volumetric forms that resembled pistons and pipes into his compositions, joining others in the Parisian vanguard in charting a more sober, conservative course that placed renewed emphasis on objective observation. Substituting hard metallic tubes for pliant flesh and flat patterned disks for soft and dense pillows, the artist updated the classical figure of the odalisque (a female slave or concubine often pictured in the history of art as a reclining nude) with his particular blend of Cubism and machine aesthetics. Reclining Woman demonstrates Léger’s interest in producing “everyday poetic images”: paintings in which the manufactured object is the “principal personage,” shown as precisely as possible to reveal an absolute sculptural value rather than sentimental associations. This work exemplifies the Purist style, a kind of industrial classicism that focused on utilitarian objects. Léger hoped that through such paintings, art would become accessible to the whole of modern society rather than to just a privileged few.",

    "artist" : "Dante Gabriel Rossetti",
    "title" : "Beata Beatrix",
    "credit" : "Charles L. Hutchinson Collection",
    "tale" : "Both a poet and a painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a circle of Victorian artists who were united in their regard for medieval aesthetics. Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for Beata Beatrix in his namesake’s La vita nuova (The New Life; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state. \nRossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from La Vita Nuova. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death. Rossetti designed the frame, and at the top right he inscribed, “How doth the city sit solitary.” This quote from La Vita Nuova refers to the city of Florence’s mourning of Beatrice. \nGiven the deeply personal nature of the work, Rossetti initially refused his patron William Graham’s request to create a replica, although he eventually yielded. The Art Institute’s painting is this second version, which is the only one to have a predella—the painted scene at the bottom of the frame—depicting Beatrice and Dante’s reunion in paradise. With this addition, Rossetti provides the medieval love story with a happy conclusion, perhaps suggesting that he, too, had begun to come to terms with his own profound grief.",

Stimulated by Duchamp’s example, Picabia pioneered a new, colorful, and intellectual visual language, of which Edtaonisl is a prime example. \nThis picture relates to Picabia’s experience aboard a transatlantic ship in 1913, on his way to the opening of the Armory Show, North America’s first major exhibition of modern art. Picabia was amused by two fellow passengers—an exotic Polish dancer named Stacia Napierskowska and a Dominican priest who could not resist the temptation of watching her rehearse with her troupe. While the tumultuous shapes in this work suggest fragments of bodies and nautical architecture, the depiction of specific forms is less important than the effective expression of contrast and rocking motion, which evokes the sensations of dance and a ship moving through rolling seas. On the top right of the canvas, Picabia painted the word Edtaonisl—an acronym made by alternating the letters of the French words étoile (star) and dans[e] (dance), a process analogous to the artist’s shattering and recombining of forms. He subtitled the work Ecclesiastic, hinting at the juxtaposition of the spiritual and the sensual.",

    "tale" : "Arnold Böcklin’s art had little in common with Impressionism or the academic art of his time. Instead, his depictions of demigods in naturalistic settings interpret themes from Classical mythology in an idiosyncratic, often sensual manner. In the Sea, part of a series of paintings of mythological subjects, displays an unsettling, earthy realism. Mermaids and tritons frolic in the water with a lusty energy and abandon verging on coarseness. Occupying the center of the composition is a harpplaying triton. Three mermaids have attached themselves to his huge frame as if it were a raft; the one near his shoulder seems to thrust herself upon him. The work’s sense of boisterousness is tempered by the ominously shaped reﬂection of the triton and mermaids in the sea and by the oddness of the large-eared heads that emerge from the water at the right. In addition to imaginative, bizarre interpretations of the Classical world, Böcklin painted mysterious landscapes punctuated by an occasional lone figure. These haunting later works made him an important contributor to the international Symbolist movement. They also appealed to some Surrealist artists, particularly Giorgio de Chirico, who declared, “Each of [Böcklin’s] works is a shock.”",

These early paintings, often executed in series, feature scenes of upper-class leisure pursuits—in this case, women and men competing with one another in the popular sport of croquet, which had recently been introduced to the United States from the British Isles. In Croquet Scene, one of five paintings Homer completed on the subject, progress on “the grand round” seems fairly advanced. The crouching male figure positions the ball belonging to the woman dressed in red. She is about to croquet (or “send up the country”) another ball, probably belonging to the woman in the left foreground, who shields her eyes against the bright afternoon sun. Notable for its bold patterning, strong contours, and brilliant light effects, the painting epitomizes the spirit of a breezy summer afternoon.",

    "tale" : "Carl Blechen is regarded as a pivotal figure in nineteenth-century German painting; his short career marks the transition from Romanticism to a more realistic view of nature. Although he is best known for scenes in which a carefully observed Italian landscape served as the backdrop for mysterious or nostalgic figures, The Palm House represents an important detour in his work. In 1832 Blechen was commissioned by Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia (r. 1797–1840) to paint two views of an exotic pleasure building recently constructed near Potsdam. The architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed the Palm House for the king’s collection of palms. It was situated on the Pfaueninsel, or Peacock Island, a favorite royal retreat dotted with whimsical buildings such as a tiny castle and a Gothic dairy. Blechen’s painting is both a record of the building, with its lush palms and fragments of an Indian temple, and an evocation of a fantasy world peopled by beautiful women purposefully playing to the viewer’s imagination. After completing two exquisite, small paintings for the king, Blechen made this grand version for public viewing. The Palm House was one of the artist’s most ambitious statements, for he soon succumbed to melancholy and madness.",

According to the biblical story, when her city was besieged by the Assyrian army, the beautiful young widow gained access to the quarters of the general Holofernes. After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head. \nVan Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag. The interplay between the straining pose of the figure, the dramatic lighting, and the fastidiously recorded surfaces serves to heighten the tension of this composition.",

    "tale" : "Although still-life ensembles were an important element in many of the major paintings of the avant-garde artist Édouard Manet, his most sustained interest in the genre itself was from 1864 to 1865, when Fish was painted. Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” (nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enliven-ing the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.",

    "tale" : "One of the most individual sculptors of his age, Francesco Mochi possessed an astoun- ding technical prowess. Although his output was relatively small, Mochi was one of the most original artists to emerge in seventeenth-century Italy. His art is distinguished by energetic lines, dramatic movement, and subtle psychology. Here a taut precision characterizes the youth’s garment, and a carefully composed rhythm governs Mochi’s virtuoso treatment of the corkscrew curls. In contrast to the greater precision of the hair and drapery, the wistful expression of the youth, with his slightly parted lips, endows the sculpture with life. This work may have been conceived as a portrait, but it is more likely a biblical or mythological subject. The almost transcendent expression suggests that the sculpture may represent a religious figure, such as the youthful Saint John the Baptist. Its small scale suggests that the work was intended as an object for private contemplation.",

    "tale" : "Early in his career, Diego Rivera enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter. After years of rigorous art training in Mexico City, he traveled throughout Europe from 1907 to 1910. In l9l2 Rivera settled in Paris, where he befriended other emigré avant-garde artists, such as Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. During World War l, he became a leading member of a group of Cubists that included Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Jean Metzinger. \nThe subject of this portrait is Rivera’s lover at the time, Marevna Vorobëv-Stebelska, a Russian-born painter and writer. Photographs of the sitter, which show her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose, reveal Rivera’s gifts of observation. Seated in an overstuffed armchair, she turns away from the book she holds in her lap, as if momentarily—perhaps angrily—distracted. Vorobëv-Stebelska is stylishly dressed in a gold-brocade bodice, white sleeves, and a dress whose shape hints at a pair of crossed legs. To her right appears a green, faux-marble form that may be a fireplace, and behind her is a schematically rendered window and shutters. In this Synthetic Cubist composition, Rivera used color to suggest spatial recession, making the planes meant to be closer to the viewer brighter than those at further remove. The painting’s somber and rich color harmonies recall the palette of Gris. \nFollowing World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera, like many other artists in Paris, rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate for the new age. In 1921 the painter returned to Mexico, which itself had emerged from a decade of revolutionary struggle. There, adopting monumental forms that suited the country’s new political reality, he began to produce work for which he is acclaimed today: paintings, graphics, and, above all, murals depicting Mexican political and cultural life.",

As a young man, he traveled to Italy to study such Old Masters as Piero della Francesca. Aside from this direct experience, Balthus received little formal schooling; this permitted him to develop his own unique artistic vision. In 1933 he began painting the erotically charged images for which he is best known—enigmatic scenes of young girls lost in reverie that often place the viewer in the position of voyeur. \nBalthus spent most of World War II in Switzerland, where in 1943 he painted Solitaire. The striking posture of the girl, deep in thought as she considers the cards on the table, is one the artist used in a number of earlier works. The insistent verticals of the patterned wallpaper create a counterpoint to the diagonal of the girl’s back; the mysterious expression of her shadowed face contrasts with the strong, raking light that defines her delicate, long fingers. These details suggest how carefully Balthus orchestrated the painting’s unsettling emotional tenor.",

    "tale" : "Interrupted Reading is among the most compelling of Camille Corot’s late figure paintings. Corot almost never exhibited these studies of the human form, preferring instead to publicize the idyllic landscapes that were his specialty. To emphasize the private nature of Interrupted Reading, Corot enclosed his model within the protective environment of the artist’s studio. The mood of the painting is introspective and somewhat melancholic, the very essence of the Romantic sensibility. The muse-like image of a woman reading a book was a popular one in nineteenth-century art, but Corot chose to show his model pausing, looking up from this activity. Having spent a number of years in Italy and being a lover of everything Italian, the artist often furnished his models with Italianate costumes such as the one worn here. Whereas Corot’s subject matter is traditional, his technique is not. With direct and bold brushwork, he explored the human form as a construction of masses that support and balance one another. This broad handling is complemented by the artist’s obvious delight in detail—the ribbon in the model’s hair, the delicate earrings, the deep folds in the skirt. Here he combined a profound sense of formal structure with the dreamy softness and intimacy that characterize his most famous landscapes.",

    "tale" : "The landscape painter George Inness once explained, “The true purpose of the painter is simply to reproduce in other minds the impression which a scene has made upon him … to awaken an emotion.” Inness sought, particularly in his later years, to record not so much the appearance of nature as its poetry. To achieve this, he limited his subject matter to, in his words, “rivers, streams, the rippling brook, the hillside, the sky, the clouds.” For half a century, the artist captured these moisture-laden subjects in all seasons, during all hours of the day and night. First he made small, quick sketches in the field or wood, and then, in the seclusion of his studio, he used them to create the more than one thousand oils credited to him. \nInness completed The Home of the Heron near the end of his career, after he had finally achieved a degree of comfort and success. The painting is characteristic of his late work, with loosely rendered detail and dim objects that seem bathed in an almost incandescent glow. The picture’s blurred outlines, broad handling, and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the heron, masterfully evoke nature’s stillness and mystery. With more than two dozen canvases by Inness, the Art Institute has one of the most comprehensive collections of the painter’s work."

Combining a hallucinatory palette with expressionist brushwork, his paintings have a mysterious, often melancholic air. Doig works exclusively from found images, drawing inspiration from film stills, newspaper clippings, personal photo albums, record album covers, and the work of earlier artists such as Edvard Munch and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The image of the two men in Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre derives from a photograph taken when the artist was working as a dresser at the London Coliseum. One night, after a production of Igor Stravinsky’s burlesque ballet Petrouchka (1911), Doig and a friend donned costumes from the performance and comically posed for a snapshot. The artist initially used the photo as the basis for a figure study; he then superimposed the two figures on a landscape he borrowed from an antique postcard, which depicts the vista from an old German tavern, Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre. In Doig’s version, the view has undergone strange chromatic shifts, resulting in a fantastical, nocturnal scene that resembles a theatrical backdrop. The men at the gate are an otherworldly presence; the winding path behind them seems to lead to another realm beyond the edge of the painting.",

Beginning in 1939, he was employed by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. \nWhite’s father was a railroad and steel worker and his mother was a domestic worker; this inspired in White a deep respect for labor. Harvest Talk, one of six charcoal and carbon pencil drawings originally exhibited at ACA Galleries in New York in 1953, exemplifies the artist’s mature drawing style. Here his strong, assured manner, coupled with the heroic proportions of the figures and the emphasis on the large scythe (an emblem often associated with the Soviet Union)—as well as the social realist sensibilities that prevail throughout his oeuvre, his travels to the Soviet Union, and his writings for and affiliation with left-wing publications such as Masses and Mainstream, Freedomways, and the Daily Worker—suggest that Harvest Talk was inspired by socialist ideals.

    "tale" : "The work of Giorgio de Chirico represents an unexpected form of classicism in early avant-garde painting. This canvas, one of six in a series, combines a Mediterranean cityscape with still-life objects. Familiar elements appear in many of de Chirico’s paintings like pieces of a mysterious puzzle: a classical arcade, oddly oversize artichokes, a cannon and cannonballs, a clock, an industrial brick chimney, a monumental tower, a running train, and a square-rigged sailing ship. Here the stage set for this extraordinary juxtaposition of objects is an Italian piazza, virtually deserted except for the menacing shadowy figures outside the edge of the scene. \nDe Chirico represented objects with a matter-of-fact, though intentionally crude, precision. He painted his scenes flatly, in bright colors, and illuminated them with a cold white light. Rendered in this clear style, works like The Philosopher’s Conquest seem rife with meaning, though they remain resolutely enigmatic. Indeed, by juxtaposing incongruous objects, the artist sought to produce a metaphysical quality, what he called “art that in certain aspects resembles … the restlessness of myth.” De Chirico’s works would profoundly affect the Surrealists, who in the 1920s and 1930s attempted to portray dreams and images of the subconscious in their work.",

In his paintings of the early 1930s, the artist often interpreted structures in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Obviously not a literal representation of that location , … And the Home of the Brave—with its compressed and discontinuous space, emphasis on two- dimensional patterns, and rearrangement of observed facts into a new pictorial reality—is derived from Cubism. The accent on American urban and commercial forms acknowledges Demuth’s roots: specifically, the double water towers at the apex of the composition are adapted from those atop a Lancaster cigar factory, while the number 72 at the lower edge of the painting refers to a state highway—the Manheim Pike—running north from town. \nDemuth derived the title from the last line of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which was adopted as the national anthem in 1931, the year in which he executed the painting. The ambiguity suggested by the title is characteristic of the artist’s ironic temperament. Like other American artists and intellectuals of the early twentieth century, he was simultaneously attracted to the vitality of contemporary civilization and the beauty and power of the machine, and conflicted about the inhuman aspects and utilitarian coarseness of the expanding industrial landscape of the United States.",

    "tale" : "A studio assistant to the painter Sir Thomas Lawrence and a portraitist in his own right, John Simpson painted this compelling image of a man in shackles as a powerful abolitionist statement. Simpson’s model was the freeborn American Ira Aldridge, a celebrated Shakespearean actor and the first black man to play Othello on the London stage. The Captive Slave highlights his gifts as a tragic actor as well as responding to—and even transcending—the historical moment to which it belongs. \nCompositionally, Simpson likely drew inspiration from Christian iconography of suffering and martyred saints. Here, Aldridge’s expressive upward gaze—modeled on representations of saintly devotion—conveys a yearning for freedom. Despite his manacled hands, Aldridge holds his body upright, and his loose, flame-red garment lends him a nobility that belies his role as a slave in the galley of a ship from Africa. Simpson conveys the rough texture of the robe through his loose, bold brushstrokes, a technique his teacher Lawrence used to different effect for his depictions of luxurious silks and satins. The glint of white in the eye was a distinguishing characteristic of Simpson’s portraiture, and his artful application of highlights is noticeable on the shackles and fingernails. \nIn 1827, when The Captive Slave was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, the accompanying catalogue included William Cowper’s antislavery poem \"Charity\" (1782). By the mid-1820s, the moral and political debates surrounding abolitionism were at the forefront of public discourse in England as well as in the rest of Europe and America. Combining late Romanticism with the new interest in social realism, The Captive Slave conveys the passion of Simpson’s abolitionist beliefs at a critical juncture in English history.",

Jeanne Mouquin, the proprietor’s wife, shares a drink with James B. Moore, a wealthy playboy and restaurateur, while the artist’s wife, Edith, and art critic Charles Fitzgerald are reflected in the mirror behind them. Glackens used vivid brushwork to describe Jeanne Mouquin’s dress, while depicting her with an intent gaze that imbues the scene with tension and mystery. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.",

    "tale" : "Beginning in 1917, Henri Matisse spent most winters in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed \"faked, absurd, delicious!\" Interior at Nice is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop, all done in the realistic style to which he had returned around this time. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light. \nAdditionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition’s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea. Framed by shimmering curtains, she gazes directly at the viewer.",

    "tale" : "William Merritt Chase was one of the most influential painters in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. After an extended stay in Europe, which ended when he established his studio in New York City in 1878, Chase demonstrated his extraordinary versatility, painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and genre scenes. His vigor as an artist was equaled by his long and successful career as a teacher: his classes at the Art Students League in New York and the Shinnecock Hills Summer School on Long Island attracted many students. \nIn the mid-1880s, Chase embarked on a group of plein-air paintings inspired by New York’s parks. Influenced by the brilliant colors and unorthodox compositional formats of the French Impressionists, he often countered a broad, comparatively empty foreground with a detailed background. In this painting, which probably depicts Brooklyn’s Tompkins Park, almost half the canvas is filled by the wide, empty walkway, which, with its strong diagonal borders, carries the eye into the composition. This swift movement into space is slowed by the woman on the bench, who appears to gaze expectantly toward someone approaching along the path. To the left, colorful flowers provide a contrast to the bare walk at the right. This informal, seemingly spontaneous work, capturing the sparkle, light, and activity of a summer day, testifies to the freshness and vitality that Chase brought to the painting of such scenes.",

He moved in part to escape political unrest but also because he felt that it was increasingly difficult to get commissions in his native land. A leader of the Mexican mural movement of the 1920s and 1930s, Orozco claimed to have painted Zapata to finance his trip back to New York after completing a mural commission in California. For liberal Mexicans, Emiliano Zapata became a symbol of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) after his assassination in 1919. The charismatic Zapata crusaded to return the enormous holdings of wealthy landowners to Mexico’s peasant population. Here his specterlike figure appears in the open door of a peasant hut. Despite the drama before him, the revolutionary hero seems solemn and unmoved. The painting is filled with menacing details—the bullets, the dagger, and especially the sword aimed at Zapata’s eye—and the somber palette of dark reds, browns, and blacks further underscores the danger of the revolutionary conflict.",

Here four women wrapped in shawls slowly stroll through the garden. The two closest to the viewer avert their gazes and curiously cover their mouths. Their somber outlines echo the two orange cones, which probably represent shrubs wrapped against the frost. The bench along the upper-left path rises steeply, defying logical perspective. Equally puzzling is the mysterious bush on the left, in which Gauguin consciously embedded forms that suggest eyes and a nose, creating the impression of a strange, watchful presence. With its aura of repressed emotion and elusive meaning, Arlésiennes (Mistral) explores the ambiguities, mysteries, and emotions that Gauguin believed underlie appearances.",

    "tale" : "Born into a family of decorative and house painters, Georges Braque once remarked that his decision to become a painter was no more premeditated than his choosing to breathe. After apprenticing in his father’s shop and studying at an art school in his hometown of Le Havre, he went to Paris. In 1905, at the annual Salon d’Automne, he was confronted by the arresting paintings of Henri Matisse and others who had begun to employ vibrant, unmixed colors and energetic, rhythmic brushwork. The unbridled intensity of these works prompted a disapproving critic to call the artists \"fauves\" (wild beasts). Braque quickly joined the group. \nBraque painted  Landscape at L’Estaque  on his first trip to this town on the French Mediterranean coast. He and other young artists were drawn to Provence, in southeastern France, because of its clear light and because of their reverence for the art of Paul Cézanne, who worked in and around the area until his death in 1906. Braque drew upon Cézanne’s use of faceted brushwork, distorted perspectives, and color to structure his compositions for this view down a steep, tree-lined road. Using a palette of highly saturated reds, oranges, and yellows, Braque evoked a sense of turbulent heat, despite the shade provided by the trees. Cézanne’s influence continued to exert itself over Braque in other, critical ways: in early 1908, he would join Pablo Picasso in the development of a revolutionary new style based on the formal construction that constitutes the core of Cézanne’s vision. That style would come to be known as Cubism.—Entry,  Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013, p.102.",

    "tale" : "This work, the earliest European still life in the Art Institute’s collection, was painted by a leading Spanish practitioner of this new genre. It employs Juan Sánchez Cotán’s signature format: commonplace edibles placed in a shallow, niche-like embrasure with an impenetrable, dark background evoking the larders in Spanish homes used to keep food fresh. Some of the artist’s still lifes contain few objects, while in others, such as this one, the recess is filled. The objects are painstakingly rendered, and their placement seems mathematically exact. The hanging quince and game birds are arranged not perpendicular to the bottom edge of the painting, but on a barely perceptible diagonal. Further enlivening the composition is the strong light that sweeps over the still life and creates a dramatic contrast of light and shade, of precise realism and abstract form. After 1603 the artist stopped creating these austere and powerful images. Sánchez Cotán left his successful artistic career in Toledo to join the Carthusian order as a lay brother at the Charterhouse of Granada. Thereafter, his work consisted solely of idealized religious images.",

As a watercolorist, Homer adapted his practice to the diverse locales he visited. His sojourns in the tropics took him to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cuba, and various locations in Florida. In each new environment, the self-taught artist pushed the flexible medium in new directions as he applied his increasingly sophisticated understanding of color and light to a new set of atmospheric conditions. This compelling watercolor was painted during Homer’s second trip to the Bahamas in the winter of 1898–99. Depicting a luckless man washed up on the beach, surrounded by fragments of his shattered craft, the work demonstrates the artist’s fascination with the rapid and dangerous weather changes of the region. Here sunlight glints through gradually thinning storm clouds. Homer employed thickly applied opaque red and yellow pigments for the seaweed tossed on the sand, creating a contrast with the thin washes and fluid brushstrokes that he used to render the receding waves.",

    "tale" : "Rosalba Carriera is renowned for the distinction she brought to pastel portraiture in Italy and France during the first half of the eighteenth century. No female artist enjoyed greater success or exerted more influence on the art of her era than Rosalba, as she is known. The artist’s work in pastel divides itself into two categories: portraits and allegories. A shrewd judge of character, she enhanced but never obscured the actual appearance of the sitters in her portraits. In contrast, her allegorical types are often so generalized that they can seem repetitive, bland, and undistinguished. A Young Lady with a Parrot is an intriguing combination of both genres. The colorful parrot is a witty conceit that subtly transfers the provocative gesture of baring one’s breast from the young woman to a mischievous bird, whose beak pulls back the gauzy fabric that edges the sitter’s bodice. With its rich colorism and vaporous effects, A Young Lady with a Parrot is a mature work, exhibiting the assurance of Rosalba’s finest and most famous portraits. The pastel may depict a young Englishwoman, perhaps one of the daughters of Lord Manchester. Whoever the model, this image’s aura of grace and seduction was to characterize the arts of much of the century, marking Rosalba as one of the originators of the Rococo style in Italy and France.",

    "tale" : "Throughout his career, Édouard Manet managed to shock and confound the public with his bold technique and unorthodox approach to subject matter. The most startling feature of his great religious composition Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers is that it was painted at all. After the advent of the Realist movement in earlier nineteenth-century French painting, grounded in the here and now, avant-garde artists in France did not pursue religious themes. Yet, while Manet was most certainly a painter of secular subjects—indeed, he was particularly urbane in his themes and lifestyle—he was also interested in the biblical narratives that had compelled artists for many centuries. It is likely that there was a connection between this interest and the popular 1863 biography Vie de Jésus (Life of Jesus) by the French philosopher and historian Joseph-Ernest Renan, a controversial work that emphasizes Christ’s humanity. \nIn this painting, Manet portrayed Jesus as very human and vulnerable by presenting him frontally; by making him seem passive, almost limp; and by surrounding him with rather gruff characters. The canvas’s visible brushstrokes and its almost monochromatic tonality create an insistent sense of materiality that further evokes a palpable, unidealized Christ. The work depicts the moment when Jesus’s captors mock the “King of the Jews” by crowning him with thorns and covering him with a robe. Although, according to the Gospel story, this taunting was followed by beatings, Manet’s soldiers appear ambivalent as they surround the pale, denuded figure. In these ways Manet managed to present a traditional subject in a contemporary, challenging light.",

Prompted by the comic strips on his children’s gum wrappers, he began to create paintings based on cartoon images. The reductive style that soon emerged became his particular contribution to the idiom known as Pop Art. From around 1961 until 1968, the artist created a group of highly finished black-and-white drawings that demonstrate his subversive use of commercial illustration techniques. In Alka Seltzer, Lichtenstein exploited everyday practices of visual representation and magnified them, indicating the gas bubbles rising over the glass by meticulously scraping away extra spaces from a field of imitation hand-stenciled Benday dots. To signify the reflective surface of the glass, he drew flat black graphite shapes—a parody, like the dots, of the reductive, linecut effect of pulp advertising. The artist’s use of mechanical reproduction conventions served to unify his composition and produce movement and volume on a two-dimensional surface. Alka Seltzer is one of Lichtenstein’s watershed works because it shows the artist summing up his early graphic techniques and introducing what would become his most significant formal preoccupations in the years that followed.",

While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism. \nIn his 1931 autobiography, My Life, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism. \nChagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s Praying Jew is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of The Praying Jew before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.",

    "tale" : "The American Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton painted Cotton Pickers based on notes of a trip he made to Georgia in the late 1920s. He depicted the dignity of the cotton pickers in the face of backbreaking labor and intense summer heat, rendering the dry fields and the working bodies in a sinuous, curvilinear style. Benton held progressive views on race, social relations, and politics, and he believed ardently that African American history was central to the understanding of American culture. Cotton sharecropping, an agricultural system that developed after the Civil War, allowed landowners to rent land to poor farmers in return for a share of the crops. Because sharecropping kept agricultural laborers impoverished, it became a symbol of a racially and economically unjust system. Cotton cultivation became one of Benton’s most important subjects, especially as the rapid industrialization of the nation during World War II changed the American landscape.",

    "tale" : "In early 1908, Georges Braque began an artistic collaboration with Pablo Picasso. From 1909 until Braque was mobilized for World War I, they worked in creative dialogue, breaking down and reformulating the representation of objects and their structure. In doing so, they pioneered one of the most radical artistic revolutions of the twentieth century, Cubism. Little Harbor in Normandy is the first fully realized example of Braque’s early Cubist style. He described the English Channel coast in severe geometries and a sober palette, reduced in range and intensity to pale shades of color. His compressed treatment of space and use of a shifting perspective seems to propel the two sailboats forward to the front edges of the picture. To further energize the scene, the artist added a fringe of whitecaps to the sea and dashes of clouds across the sky. His repetitive, striated modeling of form, inspired by his study of the art of Paul Cézanne, increased the rigid tension of this canvas. Documentation suggests that Little Harbor in Normandy was exhibited in Paris in March 1909 at the Salon des Indépendants, making this painting the first major Cubist work to be shown in such a prominent venue.",

    "tale" : "Henri Matisse was fascinated by the cultures of North Africa and the Middle East. In 1903 he visited an Islamic art exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris; in 1910 he traveled to Munich for a major display of Islamic objects and then to Spain to see Moorish architecture. He also collected brilliantly colored and richly ornamented textiles, pottery, and tiles. It was, however, the physical experience of these lands that proved to have the greatest impact on Matisse’s vision and creativity. In May 1906 and for long periods between January 1912 and February 1913, he traveled to North Africa. There, he came to understand the unique quality of light and its effect on the perception of color and space. \nEven a decade later, while Matisse lived in the southern French city of Nice, these experiences would continue to transform his work. In Woman before an Aquarium, the paneled screen and goldfish are pictorial elements drawn from Matisse’s Moroccan journeys. Moreover, the artist’s own transformation—the “new rhythm” of his inner vision that resulted from his travels—was responsible for the particular luminosity, cool palette, and intimate effect of this canvas. Matisse was entranced by the golden light and sea-soaked atmosphere of Nice, and his paintings from this period demonstrate his newfound interest in an impressionistic naturalism that was not a rejection of his earlier work but rather an effort to infuse his previous style with a “human element.”",

Hesse considered Hang Up among her most important works because it was the first to achieve the level of “absurdity or extreme feeling” she intended. Produced at the height of Minimalism and the Pop Art movement but belonging to neither, the piece was fabricated by her friend the artist Sol LeWitt, and her husband, Tom Doyle, who wrapped the wood stretcher with bed sheets and attached the cord-covered steel tubing. Sealed with acrylic, the object is subtly shaded from pale to dark ash gray. It is an ironic sculpture about painting, privileging the medium’s marginal features: the frame and its hanging device, represented by the cord that protrudes awkwardly into the gallery. The title might be understood as a humorous instruction for the sculpture’s display but also acts on a more psychological level. Collapsing the space between the viewer and the artwork, Hang Up creates a sense of disorientation and toys with our ability to discern a clear demarcation between painting and sculpture.",

He was largely self-taught, and as a teacher at Chicago’s Institute of Design (1946–61), he continued to learn by assigning photographic problems to students and then solving them himself. Influenced by both the classicism of Ansel Adams and the experimentalism of László Moholy-Nagy, Callahan fused formal precision and exploration with personal subjectivity. He photographed a wide range of subjects—female pedestrians lost in thought on Chicago’s streets; architectural facades; his wife, Eleanor; and weeds and grasses in snow. Chicago, one of his best-known pictures, shows trees covered in snow along Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive. Although Callahan captured all of the detail available in the bark and snow in his negative, he purposely printed this image in high contrast to emphasize the black-and-white forms of the trees against the stark backdrop. With a graphic sensibility typical of the Institute of Design, Callahan reminds the viewer that a photograph is first and foremost an arrangement of tones and shapes on a piece of paper.",

    "tale" : "\"Ten years ago, while driving up the central coast of California, I spotted a fallen tree in a meadow just off the highway. I was instantly drawn to it. It was not only a beautiful log, but to my eyes, it was perfectly embedded in the meadow where it had fallen decades earlier. Pressure from the weather, insects, ultraviolet radiation, and gravity were evident. Total collapse appeared to be no more than a handful of years away. I was inspired to make a sculpture and studied many other logs, but I realized that I was only interested in this particular one. \nAt one point, I determined that its armature could be its pneuma, the Greek word for breath, wind, or life. Later, I considered making an inflatable sculpture but realized that the tailoring of the form would bring an unwanted complexity to the surface. It then struck me that the breath or life of the sculpture could be manifested in the very act of sculpting. Making a wood carving of the log by starting from the inside and working my way out would bring a trajectory of life and intentionality to this great fallen tree. With several friends, I transported the tree, cut apart by a chainsaw, back to my Los Angeles studio. Silicone molds were taken and a fiberglass version of the log was reconstructed. This was sent to Osaka, Japan, where master woodworker Yuboku Mukoyoshi and his apprentices carved my vision into reality using Japanese cypress (hinoki). I was drawn to the woodworkers because of their tradition of copying work that is beyond restoration. In Japan, when an old temple or Buddha can no longer be maintained, it is remade. I visited Japan often and had a difficult time bringing this work to completion and allowing it to go out into the world. When I asked Mr. Mukoyoshi about the wood and how it would behave over time, he told me that the wood would be fine for 400 years and then it would go into a crisis; after two hundred years of splitting and cracking, it would go into slow decline for another 400 years. I realized then that the wood, like the original log, had a life of its own, and I was finally able to let my project go and hopefully breathe life into the world that surrounds it.\" \n— Charles Ray",

    "tale" : "Following a period spent producing Parisian scenes in the style of Édouard Vuillard and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard virtually reinvented his art around 1905. The artist’s new emphasis on large-scale compositions, bold forms, and brilliant colors shows his awareness of the work of his contemporaries Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as does his focus on Arcadian landscapes, a theme he had not previously explored. Part of a series of four canvases painted for his dealers, Josse and Gaston Bernheim, between 1916 and 1920, Earthly Paradise demonstrates Bonnard’s new, daring investigations of light, color, and space. Here the artist used foliage to create a proscenium-like arch for a drama involving a brooding Adam and recumbent Eve. The contrast Bonnard established between the figures seems to follow a tradition in which the female, presented as essentially sexual, is connected with nature, while the male, essentially intellectual, is able to transcend the earthly. Heightening the image’s ambiguity is an array of animals, including birds, a monkey, rabbits, and a serpent (here reduced to a garden snake). This less-than-Edenic paradise may reflect the artist’s response to the destruction of Europe during World War I, which was still raging when he began the painting."

Louis Sullivan’s foremost student, Wright continued his teacher’s search for an indigenous American architecture. Like Sullivan, Wright drew inspiration from nature and natural forms, and both men were pioneers of the Prairie School of architecture, characterized by low-slung, horizontal lines and rambling, open spaces that reflect the gently rolling landscape of the Midwest. Odes to the middle-class American family at the turn of the century, Wright’s residences are organic, designed not only to adapt to a family’s changing structure but also to contain the sense of a unified and harmonious whole. Every detail of the Coonley complex, like all of Wright’s projects, bore his personal imprint, down to the creation and placement of the furniture and the design of this window. Referencing such Americana as the flag and colored balloons, Wright explored the use of glass both as a transparent screen uniting exterior and interior and as a decorative element, the colors and design of which anticipate the later abstractions of Piet Mondrian.",

One pair of his arms balances the flame of destruction and the hand drum (damaru) that beats the rhythm of life while another performs symbolic gestures: the raised right hand means “fear not,” and the left hand (gajahasta) pointing down toward his raised left foot signifies release from the ignorance that hinders realization of the ultimate reality. Shiva is shown perfectly balanced, with his right leg planted on the demon of darkness (Apasmara), stamping out ignorance. The tiny figure of the personified river goddess, Ganga, is caught up in his matted, flowing locks. Shiva was believed to break the fall of the great Ganges River as it descends from the Himalayas by standing beneath the waters, which divide over his hair, becoming the seven holy rivers of India.

    "tale" : "Trained as an architect, the Chilean-born Roberto Matta moved to France in 1933, where he worked in the studio of Le Corbusier. The following year, he met the poet Federico García Lorca in Spain. After Lorca was assassinated by agents of Francisco Franco in 1936, Matta began a screenplay, The Earth Is a Man, which he wrote in tribute to the slain hero. The play’s apocalyptic imagery, rapidly shifting perspectives, and emotionally charged language became the principal source of Matta’s visual art over the next five years. The painting The Earth Is a Man represents the culmination of this project and draws on the artist’s earlier compositions, which he called “Inscapes” or “Psychological Morphologies.” In these, using a technique of psychic automatism developed by the Surrealists, Matta created turbulent forms that serve as visual analogues for states of consciousness. \nIn this powerful, enigmatic work, forces of brilliant light seem to battle those of darkness. The artist spilled, brushed, and wiped on vaporous washes of paint to render the invisible waves of energy that shape and dissolve a molten, primordial terrain. The painting’s visual intensity evokes the tumultuous eruption of a volcano, such as one Matta had witnessed in Mexico in 1941. Exhibited shortly after its completion in New York City, where he had immigrated at the onset of World War II, the mural- size canvas, with its abstract and visionary qualities, enthralled and influenced a new generation of American artists, who would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.",

    "tale" : "Gustave Moreau developed a highly personal vision that combined history, myth, mysticism, and a fascination with the exotic and bizarre. Rooted in the Romantic tradition, Moreau focused on the expression of timeless enigmas of human existence rather than on recording or capturing the realities of the material world. \nLong fascinated with the myth of Hercules, Moreau gave his fertile imagination free rein in Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra. Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra’s seventh, “immortal” head, which he will later bury. \nDespite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau’s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting. \nMoreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns. He was profoundly affected by France’s humiliating military defeat by Prussia in 1870–71. Whether or not Hercules literally personifies France and the Hydra represents Prussia, this monumental work portrays a moral battle between the forces of good and evil, and of light and darkness, with intensity and power.",

Breaking with the currents of the time, he adopted direct carving, combined different materials for single works, and simplified form in his search for his subjects’ essential characters. His works have profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction. \nMore than any other theme, Brancusi’s series Bird summarizes his quest for a self-sufficient form. “All my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight,” the artist once said. He began the first of twenty-seven Bird sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations Maiastra, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute’s Golden Bird, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Brâncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree’s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.",

    "tale" : "This evocative character study is an early example of a type of subject that preoccupied the great Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn throughout his long career. Although his large output included landscapes, genre paintings, and the occasional still life, he focused on biblical and historical paintings and on portraits. As an extension of these interests, the artist studied the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of costume and rich, subtle lighting. Rembrandt collected costumes to transform his models into characters. Here, the gold chain and steel gorget suggest an honored military career, while the plumed beret evokes an earlier time. The broad black mass of the old man’s torso against a neutral background is a powerful foil for these trappings. The face is that of a real person, weathered and watchful, glowing with pride and humanity. The unidentified sitter, once thought to be the artist’s father, was a favorite model, appearing in many of the artist’s early works. The confident execution suggests that the young Rembrandt completed this picture about 1631, when he had left his native Leiden to pursue a career in the metropolis of Amsterdam; perhaps he wished to use this work to demonstrate his skill in a genre that combined history painting and portraiture.",

    "tale" : "Of at least fifteen pastels, drawings, and paintings that Edgar Degas created on this subject during the 1880s, The Millinery Shop is the largest and perhaps the most ambitious. As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.",

    "tale" : "In Fishing Boats with Hucksters Bargaining for Fish, Joseph Mallord William Turner translated his enduring preoccupation with the sea into a dramatic vision. The subject itself and the painting’s low horizon line derive directly from seventeenth-century Dutch sea painting. But where the boats in the seascapes of the period are almost reconstructible in their exactness, Turner’s minimal and more impressionistic depiction of vessels is secondary to the drama of roiling seas, billowing sails, and a threatening sky. With just a few figurative details, Turner roughly sketched in the standing, gesturing figure on the right, who is negotiating to buy fish from the larger, crowded fishing boat on the left. Between them is a mythical golden boat that seems to spring from the artist’s imagination, and on the distant horizon is the suggestion of progress, a steam-driven vessel. With his manipulation of translucent and opaque pigments to create a sense of atmosphere and light, Turner alluded to the insignificance of man in the face of nature’s mysterious and sublime power."

His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape. This painting may have been part of a projected series on the four Evangelists—in addition to this work, Poussin completed a companion, Landscape with Saint Matthew (1640; Gemäldegalerie, Berlin).",

Although her depictions of flowers and the southwestern landscape are powerful and evocative, O’Keeffe painted a group of cityscapes in the 1920s that are no less intriguing. She married the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1924, and the following year they moved into the Shelton, a recently completed skyscraper. O’Keeffe was fascinated by the soaring height of the building and emphasized its majesty in this painting by rendering it from the street below. In the glaring light of the emerging sun, the building becomes an abstracted series of rectangles arranged in the center of the composition. Yet the hard edges of the Shelton are softened by the numerous circular sunspots and wavy, flowing lines of smoke and steam, suggesting that despite her urban subject matter, O’Keeffe nevertheless sought to unify man-made and organic forms, just as she would in her southwestern paintings such as Black Cross, New Mexico .",

Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad."

Beginning with his early naturalistic landscapes, he reduced natural forms to their simplest linear and colored equivalents to suggest their unity and order. Eventually he eliminated such forms altogether, developing a pure visual language of verticals, horizontals, and primary colors that he believed expressed universal forces. \nIn Lozenge Composition with Yellow, Black, Blue, Red, and Gray Mondrian rotated a square canvas to create a dynamic relationship between the rectilinear composition and the diagonal lines of the edges of the canvas. Deceptively simple, his works are the result of constant adjustment to achieve absolute balance and harmony, and they reveal an exacting attention to the subtle relations between lines, shapes, and colors. The artist hoped that his paintings would point the way to a utopian future. This goal was first formulated in Holland around 1916–17 by Mondrian and a small group of like-minded artists and architects who collectively referred to their aesthetic as De Stijl (The Style). Their ideas have been extraordinarily influential for all aspects of modern design, from architecture and fashion to household objects.",

    "tale" : "The metal-frame Chicago Stock Exchange building was one of Dankmar Adler and Louis H. Sullivan’s most distinctive commercial structures. The centerpiece of this thirteen-story building was the Trading Room, a dramatic, double-height space that was designed for the daily operations of the Stock Exchange and filled with Sullivan’s lush organic ornament and stenciled patterns. Despite the singular beauty of this room, it served its original function for just fourteen years and was occupied only sporadically thereafter. In the late 1960s, the building was targeted for demolition and became the focus of an important, although ultimately unsuccessful, preservation battle. During the course of demolition, photographer and activist Richard Nickel was working to salvage ornament from the building when the unstable structure collapsed and he was tragically killed. As a tribute to Nickel and Sullivan, sections of the Trading Room stencils, molded pilaster capitals, and art glass were preserved and in 1977 the Art Institute created a complete reconstruction of this significant room in a new wing of the museum. At the same time, the monumental entry arch of the Stock Exchange was erected on the museum grounds near the corner of Monroe Street and Columbus Drive.",

    "tale" : "One of the nineteenth century’s most innovative artists, Edgar Degas often combined traditional techniques in unorthodox ways. In Ballet at the Paris Opéra, the artist creatively joined the monotype technique, rarely used in his time, with the fragile medium of pastel. Described as “the powder of butterfly wings,” pastel was the perfect medium to illustrate the onstage metamorphosis of spindly young dancers into visions of beauty as perfect and short-lived as butterflies. This work, executed on one of the widest monotype plates ever used by the artist, bears Degas’s characteristically cropped forms and odd vantage points, which effectively convey the immediacy of the scene. The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers’ zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, en pointe, but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers’ free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The Paris Opéra was the official school of the first state-supported ballet, the Académie Royale de Danse, created in 1661.",

    "tale" : "The sixty-eight fascinating Thorne Miniature Rooms feature highlights from the history of interior design and decorative arts from the thirteenth century to 1940. These enchanting miniature stage sets were conceived by Mrs. James Ward Thorne of Chicago and constructed between 1934 and 1940 by master craftsmen according to her exacting specifications, on a scale of one inch to one foot. The harmonious elegance seen here is based on two dining rooms designed by Robert Adam, the successful eighteenth-century London architect whose precise and delicate interpretation of the antique (stimulated by then-recent excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii) dictated English taste for a quarter of a century. To insure perfect conformity, Adam undertook the entire design of a house and every detail of its interior, hiring cabinetmakers to execute furniture that blended Neoclassical elements with current English forms. Instead of using wood and wallpaper, Adam carved low-relief ornament in plaster against painted panels in the style of Roman stuccos, as seen in this dining room. His furniture was often gilded in the Continental fashion, as is the side table in this room. The landscape over the table, painted by one of the many artists that Mrs. Thorne commissioned for the project, is in the style of Claude Lorrain.",

    "tale" : "Ivan Albright was born and lived most of his life in the Chicago area; because of these ties, he left many of his paintings to the Art Institute, which as a result boasts the largest public collection of the artist’s works. While Albright’s unique style has been called Magic Realism, it defies categorization. His painstaking creative process, driven by his need to record detail meticulously, involved designing sets for his paintings and creating studies of models and props—even making diagrammatic plans for colors. Albright’s desire to present the minutest subtleties of human flesh or the tiniest elements of a still life often required that he spend years on a single painting. His experience as a medical illustrator during World War I is often cited as a determinant of his later, haunting portrayals of aging and decay. \nAlbright began Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida in 1929 after Ida Rogers, then about twenty years old, answered Albright’s advertisement for a model. Ida was an attractive young wife and mother, whom Albright transformed into a sorrowful, middle-aged woman sitting in her dressing room, her flesh drooping, and the objects surrounding her worn and bare. With characteristic precision, the artist delineated even the individual hairs in the comb on the table. The material lightness and precarious placement of her possessions on the dressing table and floor seem to symbolize the vulnerability of the sitter, making this a modern vanitas painting. Ida gazes forlornly and poignantly into the mirror and, with all the dignity she can muster, powders her aging flesh.",

    "tale" : "Following the example of the revolutionary early seventeenth-century artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi chose to depict ordinary individuals in his scenes from the Bible and Greek and Roman mythology. Caravaggio had demonstrated to Manfredi and an entire generation of European artists that such lofty themes could be transformed into events experienced by ordinary people. Employing dramatic lighting and locating the action directly before the viewer, these artists were able to endow their narratives with great immediacy and power. \nCupid Chastised depicts a moment of high drama: Mars, the god of war, beats Cupid for having caused his affair with Venus, the goddess of love, which exposed him to the derision and outrage of the other gods. Venus implores him in vain to desist. Surrounded by darkness, the three figures are boldly illuminated from the left, intensifying the dynamism and impact of the composition. The sheer physicality of the figures — the crouching Venus, whose broadly realized face strays from the classical ideal; the powerful Mars, whose musculature and brilliant red drapery seem to pulsate with fury; and Cupid, whose naked flesh and recumbent position render him particularly vulnerable—conveys the violent discord of the scene. On one level a tale of domestic disturbance, the story also symbolizes the eternal conflict between love and war.",

The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional. Not locked tightly in place, his forms appear to touch and shift continually, creating a sense of volume and space that strengthens the composition and brings it to life.",

    "tale" : "In 1917 Picasso traveled to Rome to design sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev’s famed Ballets Russes. Deeply impressed by the ancient and Renaissance art of that city, he began painting monumental figures inspired by antiquity. His new classical style was influenced by the finely modeled odalisques of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and the late, oddly proportioned female nudes of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Mother and Child was also inspired by Picasso’s own life. Just three years earlier he had married Russian dancer Olga Khokhlova, and in 1921 their son Paolo was born. Between 1921 and 1923 he produced at least twelve works on the subject of mothers and children, returning to a theme that he had explored during his Blue Period. But whereas those figures are frail and anguished, his classical-period figures, with their sculptural modeling and solidity, are majestic in proportion and feeling. Here an infant sits on the mother’s lap and reaches up to touch her. The woman, dressed in a Grecian gown, gazes intently at her child. Behind them stretches a simplified background of sand, water, and sky. Picasso’s treatment of the pair is not sentimental, but the relationship expresses a serenity and stability that characterized his own life at this time.",

    "tale" : "Robert Delaunay was four years old when the Eiffel Tower was erected in Paris in the public green space known as the Champ de Mars. One of many artists to depict the landmark, Delaunay did a series of Eiffel Tower paintings, of which the Art Institute’s example is among the best known. The artist infused the dynamism of modern life into this image by employing multiple viewpoints, rhythmic fragmentation of form, and strong color contrasts. Delaunay accented the structure’s towering presence by framing it with tall buildings and placing smaller, shorter buildings, seen from above, at its base. The top of the tower seems to soar, its massive structure augmented by winglike clouds and patches of light-filled sky. \nThe artist first showed this painting in the winter of 1912, at the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris, where Guillaume Apollinaire described the work in a review as “unfinished, whether by design or accident.” Although Delaunay’s intent is not recorded, it is certain that by 1923, when this work was illustrated in the pages of the Bulletin de l’effort modern, it looked as it does today: the artist had repainted portions of the canvas and filled areas of reserve with paint.",

    "tale" : "Edvard Munch’s life and art — particularly his iconic work The Scream (1893; National Museum, Oslo) — have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety. Yet the same year he painted his radical image, Munch was experimenting with other styles and themes. Frequent visits to Paris and Berlin between 1889 and 1893 brought the Norwegian artist into direct contact with the Impressionists and Symbolists. These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in The Girl by the Window, made soon after his return home to Norway. \nIn the dead of night, a young girl in her nightgown stands in a darkened room gazing out at the city. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate everything in the room, save a suggestion of a piece of furniture at the lower right, create an unsettling and enigmatic scene. Loosely applied, somber brown tones mingle with violets and blues, evoking a feeling of melancholy and anticipation. The window functions as a symbolic barrier, separating the interior from the outside world. The sense of mystery is deepened and complicated by the fact that we cannot see the expression on the girl’s face, nor do we know what she covertly observes. She in turn appears unaware that, as she gazes from behind the curtain at something unknown outside, the artist and implied viewer are watching her.",

The monitors play four narrative sequences in perpetual loops, each chronicling an absurd misadventure of a clown (played to brilliant effect by the actor Walter Stevens). In “No, No, No, No (Walter),” the clown incessantly screams the word no while jumping, kicking, or lying down; in “Clown with Goldfish,” the clown struggles to balance a fish bowl on the ceiling with the handle of a broom; in “Clown with Water Bucket,” the clown repeatedly opens a door booby-trapped with a bucket of water that falls on his head; and finally, in “Pete and Repeat,” the clown succumbs to the terror of a seemingly inescapable nursery rhyme. The simultaneous presentation and the relentless repetition creates an almost painful sensory overload. With both clown and viewer locked in an endless loop of failure and degradation, the humor soon turns to horror.",

    "tale" : "In 1883 Winslow Homer moved to the small coastal village of Prouts Neck, Maine, where he created a series of paintings of the sea unparalleled in American art. Long inspired by the subject, Homer had spent summers visiting New England fishing villages during the 1870s, and in 1881–82 he made a trip to a fishing community in Cullercoats, England, that fundamentally changed his work and his life. The paintings he created after 1882 focus almost exclusively on humankind’s age-old contest with nature. Here Homer depicted the heroic efforts of fishermen at their daily work, hauling in an abundant catch of herring. In a small dory, two figures loom large against the mist on the horizon, through which the sails of the mother schooners are dimly visible. While one fisherman hauls in the netted and glistening herring, the other unloads the catch. Utilizing the teamwork so necessary for survival, both strive to steady the precarious boat as it rides the incoming swells. Homer’s isolation of these two figures underscores the monumentality of their task: the elemental struggle against a sea that both nurtures and deprives.",

In a letter to the Chicago lawyer Arthur Jerome Eddy, who purchased the painting in 1913 and later bequeathed it to the Art Institute, Kandinsky explained that “the presence of the cannons in the picture could probably be explained by the constant war talk that has been going on throughout the year.” Eventually, Kandinsky ceased making these references to the material world in his work and wholly devoted himself to pure abstraction.",

    "tale" : "Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church clarified and reaffirmed its doctrine and practices in an effort to combat the impact of the Protestant Reformation. This effort, known as the Counter-Reformation, recognized the educational and inspirational value of visual images and required artists to work in a style that favored clarity and dramatic fervor. \nIn 1627 Francisco de Zurbarán, then living and working in the provincial Spanish town of Llerena, painted this Crucifixion for the monastery of San Pablo el Real in prosperous Seville. In the dimly lit sacristy where it was installed, the image of Christ awed the faithful. A later commentator noted that it appeared to be a sculpture rather than a painting. Zurbarán envisioned the crucified Christ suspended outside of time and place. Conforming to Counter-Reformation dictates, the artist depicted the event occurring not in a crowd but in isolation. Emerging from a dark background, the austere figure has been both idealized in its quiet, graceful beauty and elegant rendering and humanized by the individualized face and insistent realism. Strong light picks out anatomical detail, the delicate folds of the white loincloth, and a curled scrap of paper at the base of the cross on which the artist’s name and the date of the painting are inscribed.",

The combination of cool painted plaster and silky mink tufts illustrates the Surrealist interest in uniting different elements to spark a new reality. For the Surrealists, the best means of provoking this revolution of consciousness was a special kind of sculpture that, as Dalí explained in a 1931 essay, was “absolutely useless … and created wholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangible reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character.” Dalí’s essay, which drew upon the ideas of Marcel Duchamp’s readymades, inaugurated object making as an integral part of Surrealist activities. \nInfluenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, Dalì envisioned the idea of a cabinet transformed into a female figure, which he called an “anthropomorphic cabinet.” Venus de Milo with Drawers is the culmination of his explorations into the deep, psychological mysteries of sexual desire, which are symbolized in the figure of the ancient goddess of love.",

Ivan Albright considered The Door to be his most important picture, and he worked for ten years to achieve its mesmerizing effect. He spent weeks collecting props for the painting: a marred Victorian door found in a junkyard, a faded wax funeral wreath, and a tombstone for the doorsill. Once he arranged these objects, Albright completed an elaborate charcoal underdrawing that he then covered with the intricate and obsessively painted detail that characterizes most of his work. He would often finish no more than a quarter of a square inch a day. A wrinkled, aging woman’s hand rests on the carved doorway, a faded blue handkerchief clenched between the fingers. The poignant placement of the hand, near but not touching the doorknob, only underscores the sense of remorse and mourning implied by the painting. With its profound themes of mortality and the passage of time, The Dooris a modern memento mori that encourages a consideration of the brevity of human existence.",

    "tale" : "In the summer of 1867, Claude Monet stayed with his aunt at Sainte-Adresse, an afﬂuent suburb of the port city of Le Havre, near his father’s home. The paintings he produced that summer, few of which survive, reveal the beginnings of the young artist’s development of the revolutionary style that would come to be known as Impressionism. In his quest to capture the effects of shifts in weather and light, Monet painted The Beach at Sainte-Adresse out-of-doors on an overcast day. He devoted the majority of the composition to the sea, sky, and beach. These he depicted with broad sheets of color, animated by short brushstrokes that articulate gentle azure waves, soft white clouds, and pebbled ivory sand. While ﬁshermen go about their chores, a tiny couple relaxes at the water’s edge. Monet did not exhibit this work publicly for almost ten years after he completed it. In 1874 he banded together with a diverse group of like-minded, avant-garde artists to mount the ﬁrst of what would be eight independent exhibitions. He included Sainte-Adresse in the second of these Impressionist shows, in 1876.",

    "tale" : "Pablo Picasso painted numerous portraits of the many women in his life. Often the circumstances surrounding his relationships or the distinct personalities of his sitters seem to have precipitated stylistic changes in his work. Marie-Thérèse Walter came into the artist’s life around 1925. Though twenty-eight years older and married, the smitten artist began to furtively reference her blond hair, broad features, and voluptuous body in his work. Perhaps acknowledging the double life they were leading, he devised a new motif: a face that encompasses both frontal and profile views. \nPicasso experimented beyond form and style, exploring different materials—including found objects such as newspaper, wallpaper, and even studio scraps—in his work. The Red Armchair demonstrates the artist’s innovative use of Ripolin, an industrial house paint that he first employed as early as 1912 for its brilliant colors as well as for its ability to provide an almost brushless finish if used straight from the can. In preparation for an exhibition of his work at the Galeries Georges Petit in 1931, Picasso began a series of large paintings of Walter, of which The Red Armchair was the first. Here he mixed Ripolin with oil to produce a wide range of surface effects—from the crisp brush marks in the yellow background to the thick but leveled look of the white face and the smooth black outlines of the figure."

A member of the circle of avant-garde artists who exhibited at Alfred Stieglitz’s gallery 291 in New York, O’Keeffe had married the progressive photographer and dealer in 1924. What she encountered during late-night walks in the desert and then transformed into Black Cross, New Mexico were probably crosses erected near remote moradas, or chapels, by the secret Roman Catholic lay brotherhoods the Penitentes. As this pioneer of American modernism approached all of her subjects, whether buildings or flowers, landscapes or bones, here O’Keeffe magnified shapes and simplified details to underscore their essential beauty. She painted the cross just as she saw it: “big and strong, put together with wooden pegs,” and behind it, “those hills … [that] go on and on—it was like looking at two miles of gray elephants.” For O’Keeffe, “painting the crosses was a way of painting the country,” a beloved region where, in 1949, she settled permanently and worked almost until her death at the age of ninety-eight.",

The potency of Cole’s image lies in its depiction of unspoiled nature. The work bears little resemblance to the terrain surrounding the falls, which was marked by factories, scenic overlooks, and hotels that accommodated the multitude of tourists who visited every year. Cole placed two Native American figures at center to emphasize the North American setting, further romanticizing this view of a resplendent wilderness that at the time faced real threats wrought by industrialization and conquest.",

    "tale" : "Throughout his career, Gerhard Richter has alternated between figuration and abstraction. Woman Descending the Staircase is one of Richter’s photo paintings, figurative works in which the artist transferred found photographs, such as personal snapshots or media images, onto canvas and then dragged a dry brush through the wet pigment, thus blurring the image and rendering the forms elusive. Here, the slightly out-of-focus quality reinforces the motion of an unknown, glamorously dressed woman descending a set of stairs. The work’s silver-blue brushwork suits the elegance of the subject with her glistening evening gown and diaphanous scarf. The composition’s subject and title evoke Marcel Duchamp’s famous work Nude Descending a Staircase (1912; Philadelphia Museum of Art). When it was exhibited in the United States at the 1913 Armory Show, Duchamp’s painting shocked Americans for its radical abstraction. Rather than honoring this modernist icon, Richter protested it, stating that he “could never accept that it had put [an end], once and for all, to a certain kind of painting.” Indeed, in the Art Institute’s work, Richter produced a hauntingly sophisticated image that floats between reality and illusion.",

Just six years later, Gris too was known as a Cubist and identified by at least one critic as \"Picasso’s disciple.\" Gris’s style draws upon Analytic Cubism—with its deconstruction and simultaneous viewpoint of objects—but is distinguished by a more systematic geometry and crystalline structure. Here he fractured his sitter’s head, neck, and torso into various planes and simple, geometric shapes but organized them within a regulated, compositional structure of diagonals. The artist further ordered the composition of this portrait by limiting his palette to cool blue, brown, and gray tones that, in juxtaposition, appear luminous and produce a gentle undulating rhythm across the surface of the painting.Gris depicted Picasso as a painter, palette in hand. The inscription, \"Hommage à Pablo Picasso,\" at the bottom right of the painting demonstrates Gris’s respect for Picasso as a leader of the artistic circles of Paris and as an innovator of Cubism. At the same time, the inscription helped Gris solidify his own place within the Paris art world when he exhibited the portrait at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1912.",

Perhaps the most iconic example from a group of double portraits of friends and associates from the 1960s, this large painting depicts contemporary-art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman in the sculpture garden of their Los Angeles home. As Hockney said, “The portrait wasn’t just in the faces, it was in the whole setting.” As relentlessly stiff and still as the objects surrounding them, the couple stands apart, his stance echoed in the totem pole to the right, hers in the figurative sculpture behind her. Mrs. Weisman’s distorted mouth also mirrors that of the totem pole. Mr. Weisman’s shadow falls possessively over the abstract sculpture at his feet. His hand is clenched so tightly it seems as if he were squeezing paint out of his fist (Hockney deliberately left the drips). Brilliant, raking light flattens and abstracts the scene. This pervasive aridity is reinforced by the segregation of living, green foliage, including the lonely potted tree, to the edges of the painting. Unsurprisingly, the Weismans did not favor Hockney’s harsh portrayal and did not keep the painting.",

Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George’s halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration. Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture.",

Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.",

Kahnweiler opened an art gallery in Paris in 1907 and in 1908 began representing Pablo Picasso, whom he introduced to Georges Braque. Kahnweiler was a great champion of the artists’ revolutionary experiment with Cubism and purchased the majority of their paintings between 1908 and 1915. He also wrote an important book, The Rise of Cubism, in 1920, which offered a theoretical framework for the movement. \nKahnweiler sat as many as thirty times for this portrait. No longer seeking to create the illusion of true appearances, Picasso broke down and recombined the forms he saw. He described Kahnweiler with a network of shimmering, semitransparent surfaces that merge with the atmosphere around him. Forms are fractured into various planes and faceted shapes and presented from several points of view. Despite the portrait’s highly abstract character, however, Picasso added attributes to direct the eye and focus the mind: a wave of hair, the knot of a tie, a watch chain. Out of the ﬂickering passages of brown, gray, black, and white emerges a rather traditional portrait pose of a seated man, his hands clasped in his lap.",

    "tale" : "In the late 1940s Jackson Pollock developed a revolutionary form of Abstract Expressionism by dripping, pouring, and splashing paint onto large-scale canvases. Pollock emphasized the expressive power of the artist’s gestures, materials, and tools, often applying paint with sticks, trowels, and palette knives instead of brushes. He also challenged the concept of easel painting by working on canvases placed either on the floor or fixed to a wall. With no apparent beginning or end, top or bottom, his paintings imply an extension of his art beyond the edges of the canvas, engulfing the viewer. Among the last great purely abstract paintings Pollock made before his untimely death in 1956, Greyed Rainbow is a quintessential example of action painting. The paint application ranges from thick chunks squeezed directly from a tube to thin, meandering lines poured from a container with a small hole or squirted from a baster. The work is predominantly black, white, gray, and silver; in the bottom third of the canvas, however, Pollock thinly concealed orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The title of the work presumably refers to these grayed sections of hidden color."

    "tale" : "When it was exhibited at the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh in 1950, The Rock was voted the show’s most popular painting. Peter Blume’s dramatic image of a shattered but enduring rock must have struck a responsive chord with many post–World War II viewers. Displaying a startling juxtaposition of images, the work evokes Surrealist dreamscapes made even more vivid by meticulous brushwork inspired by fifteenth- and sixteenth-century northern European painting. Although Blume’s imagery resists easy interpretation, the work suggests a parable of destruction and reconstruction. The jagged rock looms at the center of the composition, still upright despite the removal of its base by workers below. On the right, smoke billows around the charred timbers of a house, an image that might allude to the bombing of London during World War II. On the left, a new building, encased in scaffolding, rises as laborers in the foreground cart slabs of stone toward it. The new structure recalls Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous Fallingwater (1935–37) in southwestern Pennsylvania, the residence for which Liliane and Edgar Kaufmann commissioned the painting. Their son Edgar Kaufmann Jr. donated The Rock to the Art Institute in 1956.",

When the Art Institute acquired Inventions of the Monsters in 1943, the artist wrote his congratulations and explained: \n\"According to Nostradamus the apparition of monsters presages the outbreak of war. The canvas was painted in the Semmering mountains near Vienna a few months before the Anschluss [the 1938 political union of Austria and Germany] and has a prophetic character. Horse women equal maternal river monsters. Flaming giraffe equals masculine apocalyptic monster. Cat angel equals divine heterosexual monster. Hourglass equals metaphysical monster. Gala and Dalí equal sentimental monster. The little blue dog is not a true monster.\" \nInventions of the Monsters has an ominous mood. It is rife with threats of danger, from the menacing fire in the distance to the sibylline figure in the foreground with an hourglass and a butterfly, both symbols of the inevitability of death. Next to this figure sit Dalí and his wife and muse, Gala. With his native Catalonia embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, the artist surely felt great anxiety over a world without a safe haven, a world that indeed had allowed for the invention of monsters.",

In his quest for underlying structure and composition, he recog-nized that the artist is not bound to represent real objects in real space. Thus, The Basket of Apples contains one of his signature tilted tables, an impossible rectangle with no right angles. On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds. The heavy modeling, solid brushstrokes, and glowing colors give the composition a density and dynamism that a more realistic still life could never possess. This painting, one of Cézanne’s rare signed works, was part of an important exhibition urged on the artist by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Since Cézanne had spent the majority of his career painting in isolation in his native Provence, this was the first opportunity in nearly twenty years for the public to see the work of the artist who is now hailed as the father of modern painting.",

In his powerful, nihilistic works, tormented and deformed figures become players in dark, unresolved dramas. Bacon often referred in his paintings to the history of art, interpreting borrowed images through his own bleak mentality. Figure with Meat is part of a now-famous series he devoted to Diego Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X (c. 1650; Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome). Here he transformed the Spanish Baroque artist’s iconic portrayal of papal authority into a nightmarish image, in which the blurred figure of the pope, seen as if through a veil, seems trapped in a glass-box torture chamber, his mouth open in a silent scream. Instead of the noble drapery that frames Velázquez’s pope, Bacon is flanked by two sides of beef, quoting the work of seventeenth-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn and twentieth-century Russian artist Chaim Soutine, both of whom painted brutal and haunting images of raw meat. Framed by the carcass, Bacon’s pope can be seen alternately as a depraved butcher, or as much a victim as the slaughtered animal hanging behind him.",

Early in his career, he began to utilize the silk-screen process to transfer photographed images to canvas, creating multiple portraits of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as duplicated images of mass-produced products such as Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. In this example from his Mao series, Warhol melded his signature style with the scale of totalitarian propaganda to address the cult of personality surrounding the Chinese ruler Mao Zedong (1893–1976). Nearly fifteen feet tall, this towering work mimics the representations of the political figure that were ubiquitously displayed throughout China. Warhol’s looming portrait impresses us with the duality of its realistic qualities and its plastic artificiality. In contrast to the photographic nature of the image, garish colors are applied to Mao’s face like makeup. The gestural handling of color in the portrait shows Warhol at his most painterly.",

    "tale" : "The Impressionists frequently paid tribute to the modern aspects of Paris. Their paintings abound with scenes of grand boulevards and elegant, new blocks of buildings, as well as achievements of modern construction such as iron bridges, exhibition halls, and train sheds. Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare was an especially appropriate choice of subject for Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably placing them in the same gallery. \nMonet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure, and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a specific motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes. But the series also represented his last attempt to deal with urban realities: from this point on in his career, Monet would be largely a painter of landscapes.",

    "tale" : "Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O’Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates a series inspired by the artist’s experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O’Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O’Keeffe wrote: \n\"I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide—it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold—I worked in the garage and it had no heat—Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.\" \nIn 1970 Sky above Clouds IV was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O’Keeffe’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum’s permanent collection. \nThe special relationship between O’Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O’Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.",

A regular patron of the Moulin Rouge, one of the most famous cabarets of the Montmartre district, Toulouse-Lautrec here turned his acute powers of observation on the club’s other habitués. The ﬂaming red-orange hair of the entertainer Jane Avril is the focal point of the central seated group. Preening in the greenish mirror in the background is the dancer La Goulue. The stunted figure of the aristocratic artist appears, as it often did in life, next to his devoted, much taller cousin, Dr. Gabriel Tapié de Céleyran. But it is the frozen, acid-green face of the dancer May Milton that dominates the canvas and haunts the action. The painting comprises two joined parts: a small main canvas and an L-shaped panel to the lower and right edges. The canvas was severed after the artist’s death, perhaps by his dealer (to make the composition less radical and more saleable), and restored sometime before 1914.",

She was fascinated by these bones and shipped a number of them back to New York City. She later wrote, “To me they are as beautiful as anything I know. To me they are strangely more living than the animals walking around… . The bones seem to cut more sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert even tho’ it is vast and empty and untouchable—and knows no kindness with all its beauty.” The bones provided her with interesting shapes and textures, and she painted them frequently, intrigued as much by their symbolism as by their formal potential. \nIn Cow’s Skull with Calico Roses, O’Keeffe decorated the skull with artificial flowers, the kind used to adorn graves in New Mexico. Tucked against the ear and the jaw, the flowers appear less morbid than simply decorative—a whimsical addition that relies on the soft, ruffled petals to alleviate the hard, polished severity of the skull. O’Keeffe then exquisitely balanced the subtle modulations of the white and gray tones of the skull and flowers with a bold vertical streak of dark brown that irregularly bisects the composition. With the skull positioned against a muted, layered ground in close proximity to the picture plane, the composition conveys a sense of the organic yet abstracted beauty typical of O’Keeffe’s art.",

De Kooning completed Excavation in June 1950, just in time for it to be exhibited in the twenty-fifth Venice Biennale. His largest painting up to that date, the work exemplifies the Dutch-born innovator’s style, with its expressive brushwork and distinctive organization of space into sliding planes with open contours. According to the artist, the point of departure for the painting was an image of women working in a rice field in Bitter Rice, a 1949 Neorealist film by Italian director Giuseppe de Santis. The mobile structure of hooked calligraphic lines defines anatomical parts—bird and fish shapes, human noses, eyes, teeth, necks, and jaws—that seem to dance across the painted surface, revealing the particular tension between abstraction and figuration that is inherent in de Kooning’s work. The original white pigment has yellowed over the years, diluting somewhat the flashes of red, blue, yellow, and pink that punctuate the composition. Aptly titled, the painting reflects de Kooning’s technically masterful painting process: an intensive building up of the surface and scraping down of its paint layers, often for months, until the desired effect was achieved.",

In response, Magritte conceived On the Threshold of Liberty (in the collection of the Art Institute) and his now-famous Time Transfixed. The artist later explained this picture: “I decided to paint the image of a locomotive… . In order for its mystery to be evoked, another immediately familiar image without mystery—the image of a dining room fireplace—was joined.” The surprising juxtaposition and scale of unrelated elements, heightened by Magritte’s precise realism, gives the picture its perplexity and allure. The artist transformed the stovepipe of a coal-burning stove into a charging locomotive, situating the train in a fireplace vent so that it appears to be emerging from a railway tunnel. Magritte was unhappy with the English translation of the original French, La durée poignardé, which literally means “ongoing time stabbed by a dagger.” He hoped that the painting would be installed at the bottom of the collector’s staircase so that the train would “stab” guests on their way up to the ballroom. Ironically, James installed it over his fireplace instead.",

    "tale" : "The 1938 painting White Crucifixion represents a critical turning point for the artist Marc Chagall: it was the first of an important series of compositions that feature the image of Christ as a Jewish martyr and dramatically call attention to the persecution and suffering of European Jews in the 1930s. \nIn White Crucifixion, his first and largest work on the subject, Chagall stressed the Jewish identity of Jesus in several ways: he replaced the loincloth with a prayer shawl, his crown of thorns with a headcloth, and the mourning angels that customarily surround him with three biblical patriarchs and a matriarch, clad in traditional Jewish garb. At either side of the cross, Chagall illustrated the devastation of pogroms. On the left, a village is pillaged and burned, forcing refugees to flee by boat and the three bearded figures at bottom left—one of whom clutches a Torah—to escape on foot. On the right, a synagogue and its Torah ark go up in flames, while below a mother comforts her child. By linking the martyred Jesus with the persecuted Jews and the Crucifixion with contemporary events, Chagall’s painting passionately identifies the Nazis with Christ’s tormentors and warns of the moral implications of their actions.",

Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. The Child’s Bath is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.",

    "tale" : "In 1886 Vincent van Gogh left his native Holland and settled in Paris, where his beloved brother Theo was a dealer in paintings. Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884. But what was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years.",

Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water.

    "tale" : "“He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling in life,” an anonymous interviewer once wrote about Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This may explain why Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.",

These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.",

    "tale" : "In the mid-1950s Jasper Johns was searching for a way to move beyond Abstract Expressionism. He took the radical step of destroying his previous work and began painting a set of motifs that included numbers, the American flag, and the alphabet. These instantly recognizable images allowed him to reintroduce subject matter into his work, freeing him to explore other painterly concerns. One of the found images that Johns employed was the target, and from 1955 to 1961 the artist produced several dozen paintings and drawings that explored this device. \nInitially, Johns chose a palette of primary colors, a preexisting schema as found as the image itself. The artist’s use of oil and encaustic (pigment mixed with hot wax) created a quick-drying medium that recorded each drag and drip of the brush in almost sculptural terms. Indeed, these gestural nods to his Abstract predecessors allowed him to investigate the subtle nuances between form and material. There also exists a tension between the idea of the representational (a target) and the notion of the abstract (the geometry of concentric circles).",

    "tale" : "After decades as a representational painter, in her seventies Alma Thomas turned to abstraction, creating shimmering, mosaic-like fields of color with rhythmic dabs of paint that were often inspired by forms from nature. The artist had been fascinated with space exploration since the late 1960s, and her later paintings often referenced America’s manned Apollo missions to the moon. Although she had never flown, Thomas began to paint as if she were in an airplane, capturing what she described as shifting patterns of light and streaks of color. “You look down on things,” she explained. “You streak through the clouds so fast… . You see only streaks of color.” \nStarry Night and the Astronauts evokes the open expanse and celestial patterns of a night sky, but despite its narrative title, the work could also be read as an aerial view of a watery surface, playing with our sense of immersion within an otherwise flat picture plane. The viewer is immersed not only in the sense of organic expanse that this painting achieves, however, but also in an encounter with Thomas’s process: the surface here is clearly constructed stroke by stroke. Meanwhile, the glimpses of raw canvas between each primary-colored mark seem as vivid as the applied paint itself—almost as if the composition were backlit. Thomas relied on the enlivening properties of color throughout her late-blooming career. “Color is life,” she once proclaimed, “and light is the mother of color.” This painting was created in 1972, when the artist was seventy-seven. In the same year, she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at a major art museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.",

In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s Stacks of Wheat in the world.",

    "tale" : "Henri Matisse considered Bathers by a River to be one of the five most “pivotal” works of his career, and with good reason: it facilitated the evolution of the artist’s style over the course of nearly a decade. Originally, the work was related to a 1909 commission by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin, who wanted two large canvases to decorate the staircase of his Moscow home. Matisse proposed three pastoral images, though Shchukin decided to purchase only two works, Dance II and Music (both State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). \nFour years later, Matisse returned to this canvas, the rejected third image, altering the idyllic scene and changing the pastel palette to reflect his new interest in Cubism. He reordered the composition, making the figures more columnar, with faceless, ovoid heads. Over the next years, Matisse transformed the background into four vertical bands and turned the formerly blue river into a thick black vertical band. With its restricted palette and severely abstracted forms, Bathers by a River is far removed from Dance II and Music, which convey a graceful lyricism. The sobriety and hint of danger in Bathers by a River may in part reflect the artist’s concerns during the terrible, war-torn period during which he completed it.",

Mitchell painted large, light-filled canvases animated by loosely applied skeins of bright color—here infused with the energy of a large metropolis. \nThe title suggests a relationship between the painting’s network of pigments and the nerves or arteries of an urban space. The sense of spontaneity conveyed in City Landscape, however, belies Mitchell’s methods. Unlike many of her contemporaries, who were dubbed “action painters,” Mitchell worked slowly and deliberately. “I paint a little,” she said. “Then I sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. Eventually, the painting tells me what to do.”",

    "tale" : "This stone, commemorating the beginning of the reign of Emperor Motecuhzoma II, was originally located within the ritual center of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the extensive empire conquered by the Aztecs between 1428 and 1519. The ruins of the city lie beneath downtown Mexico City. Known as the Stone of the Five Suns, this monument draws connections between Aztec history and the cosmic scheme. The quadrangular block is carved with the hieroglyphic signs of five successive cosmic eras, called “suns” in the language of the Aztecs. These eras were mythic cycles of creation and destruction that began in the time of genesis and continued with the birth of humankind and the period of Aztec rule. From “4 Jaguar-sun” in the lower-right corner, the eras proceed counterclockwise through “4 Wind-sun,” “4 Rain-sun,” and “4 Water-sun.” The X carved in the center represents “4 Movement-sun,” the sign of the present era for the Aztecs. The year “11 Reed” in the square cartouche refers to 1503, the year of Motecuhzoma’s coronation, while the day listed above it—“1 Crocodile”—corresponds to July 15, when the ceremony probably occurred. On the underside, the hieroglyphic date “1 Rabbit” denotes the beginning of things in the distant mythological past. The sculpture thus legitimizes Motecuhzoma’s rule as part of the cycle of birth, death, and renewal and presents him as heir to the world in the present era of creation.",

After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand de-sign, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern. The vigor of El Greco’s broad brushstrokes proclaims the conﬁdent achievement of this early work, as does this artist’s large signature in Greek, painted as though afﬁxed to the surface of the picture at the lower right.",

As in other images from Nagapattinam, a flame emerges out of the Buddha’s cranial protuberance, probably signifying wisdom. This monumental granite sculpture originally would have graced a monastic site at Nagapattinam, which is also well known for its Buddhist bronzes.

    "tale" : "This complex intersection, just minutes away from the Saint-Lazare train station, represents in microcosm the changing urban milieu of late nineteenth-century Paris. Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884, painted less than a decade later.",

The elongated, angular figure of the blind musician also relates to Picasso’s interest in Spanish art and, in particular, the great 16th-century artist El Greco. The image reﬂects the twenty-two-year-old Picasso’s personal struggle and sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden; he knew what it was like to be poor, having been nearly penniless during all of 1902.",

    "tale" : "Chicago painter Archibald Motley represented the vibrancy of African American culture, frequently portraying young, sophisticated city dwellers out on the town. Nightlife depicts a crowded cabaret in the South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville, with people seated around tables and at the bar. The clock reads one o’clock, and the place is still hopping with drinkers and dancers. Two bartenders serve customers and restock the well-lit display of liquor, and couples dance furiously in the background to music provided by the jukebox at the right. The strange head atop the jukebox may be a peanut-vending machine known as “Smilin’ Sam from Alabam’”; when a coin was inserted into the head and the tongue was pulled, the machine would dispense peanuts. Motley unified the composition through his use of repeated forms and a pervasive burgundy tone that bathes the entire scene in intense, unnatural light. (The artist had seen Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks at the Art Institute the year before and was intrigued by his use of artificial light.) The stylized figures are tightly interconnected; they are arranged along a sharp diagonal that compresses the space into a stagelike setting. The dynamic composition and heightened colors vividly express the liveliness of the scene, making Nightlife one of Motley’s most celebrated paintings.",

Van Gogh conceived the first Bedroom in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, and effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.",

    "tale" : "This familiar image was exhibited publicly for the first time at the Art Institute of Chicago, winning a three-hundred-dollar prize and instant fame for Grant Wood. The impetus for the painting came while Wood was visiting the small town of Eldon in his native Iowa. There he spotted a little wood farmhouse, with a single oversized window, made in a style called Carpenter Gothic. “I imagined American Gothic people with their faces stretched out long to go with this American Gothic house,” he said. He used his sister and his dentist as models for a farmer and his daughter, dressing them as if they were “tintypes from my old family album.” The highly detailed, polished style and the rigid frontality of the two figures were inspired by Flemish Renaissance art, which Wood studied during his travels to Europe between 1920 and 1928. After returning to settle in Iowa, he became increasingly appreciative of midwestern traditions and culture, which he celebrated in works such as this. American Gothic, often understood as a satirical comment on the midwestern character, quickly became one of America’s most famous paintings and is now firmly entrenched in the nation’s popular culture. Yet Wood intended it to be a positive statement about rural American values, an image of reassurance at a time of great dislocation and disillusionment. The man and woman, in their solid and well-crafted world, with all their strengths and weaknesses, represent survivors.",

    "tale" : "Edward Hopper said that Nighthawks was inspired by “a restaurant on New York’s Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet,” but the image—with its carefully constructed composition and lack of narrative—has a timeless, universal quality that transcends its particular locale. One of the best-known images of twentieth-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Hopper’s understanding of the expressive possibilities of light playing on simplified shapes gives the painting its beauty. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. (The red-haired woman was actually modeled by the artist’s wife, Jo.) Hopper denied that he purposefully infused this or any other of his paintings with symbols of human isolation and urban emptiness, but he acknowledged that in Nighthawks “unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.”",

Seurat labored extensively over A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884, reworking the original as well as completing numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches (the Art Institute has one such sketch and two drawings). With what resembles scientific precision, the artist tackled the issues of color, light, and form. Inspired by research in optical and color theory, he juxtaposed tiny dabs of colors that, through optical blending, form a single and, he believed, more brilliantly luminous hue. To make the experience of the painting even more intense, he surrounded the canvas with a frame of painted dashes and dots, which he, in turn, enclosed with a pure white wood frame, similar to the one with which the painting is exhibited today. The very immobility of the figures and the shadows they cast makes them forever silent and enigmatic. Like all great masterpieces, La Grande Jatte continues to fascinate and elude.",
